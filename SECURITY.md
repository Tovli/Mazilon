We take the security of our software seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in our software, we encourage you to let us know right away. We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem.

Please follow these steps to report a vulnerability:

1. **Email Us**: Send an urgent email to [admin@tovli.co.il](mailto:security@example.com) detailing the potential security issue. Provide as much information as possible about the issue, including how it can be replicated, the potential impact, and any other information that might help us understand the severity and urgency of the issue.

2. **Do Not Publicly Disclose**: Please do not disclose the issue to the public or to any third parties. Allow us to resolve the issue before any public disclosure.

3. **Wait for Response**: We strive to respond to security reports quickly, typically within 24-48 hours. We will provide a detailed response indicating the next steps in handling your report.

4. **Collaboration**: Depending on the severity of the report, we may collaborate with you to address the security issue.

5. **Disclosure**: Once the issue has been resolved, we will release an update, patch, or new version as necessary. If agreed upon, we may publicly acknowledge your contribution in the patch notes or updates.

## Security Update Policy

When a security issue is discovered, we will evaluate and respond as follows:

- **Patch Release**: For critical or high severity issues, we aim to patch the vulnerability within 48 hours, depending on complexity.
- **Minor or Major Releases**: For lower severity issues, we may include the fix in the next minor or major release of the software, which we strive to release on a regular cycle.

We appreciate your help in keeping our software secure. Thank you for your understanding and support.
