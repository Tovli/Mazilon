1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("add feature" not "added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("move cursor to..." not "moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

All Dart code must adhere to the [effective Dart style guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style). Follow best practices for Flutter as outlined in the [Flutter documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs).

### Pull Request Process

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.
