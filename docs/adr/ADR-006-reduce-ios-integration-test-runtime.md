## 2026-09-02 operational update: missed VM-service announcement

The blocking iOS FCM test and existing time limits are unchanged. In
[run 33601851012](https://github.com/ClubhouseAmit/LivingPositively/actions/runs/33601851012),
Xcode completed its build, and `simulator.log` recorded Runner's VM service
at 07:52:56. Flutter's own log reader missed that announcement and waited
until the 90-minute step timeout. The post-timeout diagnostic relaunch let
the surviving Flutter process attach and report one passing test, but could
not reverse the timed-out GitHub check.

`scripts/recover_ios_vm_service.sh` now watches during the test step. It
relaunches the installed test app at most once, only when Flutter is waiting
for discovery, the exact Runner PID is still alive, and the independent
simulator log confirms that PID announced a VM service. After a two-minute
grace period it checks again that Flutter has not connected and the PID has
not changed. It preserves Flutter's debug launch arguments and original test
process. Connected tests, assertion failures, crashes, and missing evidence
do not qualify for recovery; the original `flutter test` exit status remains
the gate. Each Flutter attempt gets a fresh attempt log and a byte offset into
the simulator stream; announcements before that offset cannot authorize a
relaunch, even if a PID is reused. Recovery is disabled if the recorded Flutter
launch arguments differ from the verified debug flags in the script. The watcher polls
for the full 90-minute parent budget (including the 80–90 minute window).
The parent stops and reaps it immediately when each Flutter attempt returns,
before FrontBoard retry/reset or post-test diagnostics, with EXIT cleanup as
a fallback.

The watcher, simulator-log stream, and diagnostic watchdog each run inside a
dedicated Bash process group. Their wrapper leaders remain stopped after normal
command completion until cleanup, preventing ordinary completion from releasing
the owned group ID. Cleanup records the actual PID/PGID, parent PID, and start
time; it refuses to signal missing or mismatched owners. It freezes the group,
rechecks the stopped leader, sends one kill, polls for live members with a
bounded wait, and reaps only the owner PID. It does not repeatedly signal a
retired numeric group ID. This covers late-forked/reparented descendants that
remain in the owned group, not processes that deliberately leave it.

The EXIT trap attempts all diagnostic cleanups independently, reports cleanup
failures separately, and preserves its incoming status, including success. If
watcher cleanup fails between test attempts, no retry or post-test simulator
action is allowed; an existing test failure is preserved, or a successful test
becomes an explicit cleanup failure. The foreground Flutter test and simulator
Runner are not diagnostic cleanup targets. The shell's identity checks are not
an atomic OS process handle: external SIGKILL/PID reuse between `ps` and `kill`
remains outside this runner-local ownership guarantee.

The recovery log is included in `ios-integration-diagnostics`. Its shell
regressions run in `build-android` via
`bash scripts/tests/recover_ios_vm_service_test.sh`; they check the real log
predicates with fake simulator commands and no wall-clock sleeps.
`python3 scripts/tests/recover_ios_vm_service_cli_test.py` also exercises the
actual child-process entrypoint, exit statuses, full polling budget, and late
recovery. Its cleanup tests execute the complete production workflow run block
with fake external tools, retaining real process groups and the actual EXIT
trap, launch order, retry gate, and status propagation.
Reassess
this CI-only workaround when upgrading the pinned Flutter SDK. No runtime
application behavior or coverage threshold is changed.

## Context

ADR-005 introduced the `integration-test-ios` GitHub Actions job to cover
iOS-specific notification paths and feed the aggregate coverage gate. The ADR
expected the macOS runner job to take roughly 6-8 minutes.

The observed run at
`https://github.com/ClubhouseAmit/LivingPositively/actions/runs/26495525512/job/78022724423`
completed `integration-test-ios` in 41m58s. Step timing showed the bottleneck is
native iOS preparation/build work, not Dart test execution:

- `Run iOS integration test`: about 36m41s.
- `pod install`: 282.4s.
- `Running Xcode build`: 1791.8s.
- Actual test execution: about 1 minute for 14 passing tests.

At decision time, the job ran on `macos-26`, disabled Flutter Swift Package
Manager, and used the CocoaPods path. The repository did not track
`ios/Podfile`, so CI allowed Flutter/Xcode project generation and migration work
to happen inside the timed test step. This made the job slower and made native
build outputs harder to cache with stable keys.

The job is also on the critical path: `coverage-aggregate` depends on
`integration-test-ios`, so the slow iOS native build directly lengthens the
feedback loop for every run where the coverage gate is required.

Volatility to contain:

- GitHub macOS runner labels and installed Xcode/iOS SDK versions change over
  time.
- Flutter, FlutterFire, CocoaPods, and plugin support for Swift Package Manager
  are volatile.
- The iOS notification coverage requirement is stable.
- The current iOS test count is not the runtime driver; native dependency
  resolution and Xcode compilation are.

## Decision

Do not split the iOS integration test suite as the first optimization. There is
only one iOS integration test file, and sharding would duplicate the expensive
native build.

Benchmark the runner label first:

1. Try `macos-15` arm64 for `integration-test-ios`.
2. Keep `macos-26` only if the job needs Xcode/iOS 26 APIs or if the benchmark
   proves it is faster.
3. Do not move to Intel as the first option. Try `macos-15-intel` only if logs
   show memory pressure or if the arm64 benchmark remains dominated by native
   compilation despite cache work.
4. Treat `macos-26-intel` as a last resort when both macOS 26 tooling and Intel
   runner resources are required.

Make the iOS build cacheable before adding broader CI changes:

1. Track the generated iOS project inputs needed for a stable CocoaPods build,
   especially `ios/Podfile` and, if reproducible in this project, `ios/Podfile.lock`.
2. Add CocoaPods cache coverage for `ios/Pods` and CocoaPods download caches,
   keyed by runner OS/architecture, Flutter version, Xcode version,
   `pubspec.lock`, and `ios/Podfile.lock`.
3. Cache Xcode `DerivedData` immediately because the measured Xcode build time
   is the dominant cost. Scope this cache by runner OS, runner architecture,
   Xcode version, Flutter/plugin inputs, and iOS project inputs.
4. Keep cache keys scoped to runner architecture and Xcode version; do not share
   native iOS build caches across arm64 and Intel runners, and do not use
   restore-key fallbacks that drop the Xcode scope.
5. Keep `flutter test` on `--no-pub` because `flutter pub get` already ran
   before cache restore and simulator execution.

Do not fabricate `ios/Podfile.lock` on a Windows development machine. The first
green macOS CI run should be used to confirm that the generated lockfile is
stable for this project; if it is stable, commit `ios/Podfile.lock` in the next
CI-only follow-up so CocoaPods resolution becomes deterministic. The iOS job
uploads the generated `ios/Podfile.lock` as an artifact to make that manual
follow-up possible for contributors who do not have local macOS access. Until
then, `hashFiles('ios/Podfile.lock')` is intentionally harmless when the file is
absent, but fresh checkouts may still re-resolve transitive Pods.

Because this job is assumed to run once per day, caching is expected to remain
warm: GitHub Actions evicts caches after more than 7 days without access, and a
daily run refreshes access. Cache size must still be monitored because the
default repository cache quota is finite and large DerivedData entries can evict
more useful caches.

If the optimized job still materially exceeds the expected range, revisit the
quality gate shape rather than further optimizing simulator mechanics. The
fallback decision is to keep a smaller iOS simulator smoke test as scheduled or
nightly coverage evidence, while moving channel-mocked behavioral assertions back
to unit/widget tests where possible.

### Quality gate shape: downgrade `integration-test-ios` to telemetry

> **Superseded on 2026-08-05:** `integration-test-ios` is now a blocking
> simulator test of `integration_test/notifications_schedule_test.dart`. It no
> longer collects or uploads iOS lcov, and the former iOS-only test and checker
> were removed. The decision text below is retained as historical context.

Effective with this ADR, `integration-test-ios` is **non-blocking telemetry**:

1. The `flutter test` step and the per-file iOS coverage floor step both run
   with `continue-on-error: true`. Failures are surfaced as red step icons in
   the workflow log but do not fail the job.
2. `integration-test-ios` is **removed from `coverage-aggregate.needs`**, and
   `coverage/integration_ios.info` is no longer merged into the aggregate.
   `scripts/check_aggregate_coverage.dart` no longer treats the iOS lcov as a
   required input.
3. At the time of this decision, `coverage-integration-ios-lcov` and
   `ios-podfile-lock` continued to upload on `if: always()`. Under the
   2026-08-05 supersession, the coverage artifact was removed; the current job
   retains the Podfile lockfile and diagnostic artifacts only.

Telemetry is still explicitly time-bounded. The job has a 60-minute ceiling,
the simulator boot wait has a 10-minute ceiling, and the `flutter test` step
has a 45-minute ceiling. `continue-on-error: true` only changes the result after
a command exits or is timed out; it does not by itself interrupt a hung process.
The iOS test step also runs Flutter in verbose mode, streams filtered simulator
logs into `ci-ios-diagnostics/simulator.log`, starts a 40-minute watchdog that
captures process/simulator state before the 45-minute step ceiling, and uploads
`ios-integration-diagnostics` on `if: always()`. The iOS-only integration test
emits `IOS_TEST_MARK` lifecycle markers so logs can distinguish "Dart test
never started" from "test setup or teardown started and then hung".

This mirrors the `unit-test-web-telemetry` treatment in the same workflow and
applies the "revisit the quality gate shape" fallback proactively, rather than
waiting for the runtime optimization to prove insufficient. Reasons:

- The iOS job is the workflow's slowest critical-path step. Even after the
  ADR-006 optimizations, it runs on macOS hardware whose runner availability,
  Xcode rotation, and simulator stability are outside the project's control.
- The iOS lcov is purely additive to the union floor (max hit-count per line),
  so removing it cannot lower the 89% aggregate safety margin established by
  ADR-004 Phase 9.
- The iOS-specific per-file 60% floor on `notification_service.dart` continues
  to evaluate as job-internal telemetry; nothing about iOS coverage **content**
  changes, only the workflow-blocking semantics.

Re-promoting `integration-test-ios` to blocking is a single inverse change:
remove the two `continue-on-error: true` lines, re-add the job to
`coverage-aggregate.needs`, and restore the iOS branch in
`check_aggregate_coverage.dart`. This should happen once macOS runner runtimes
and cache hit-rates are stable enough that the job's failure modes match the
other gates (typically <10 minutes runtime, <1% non-determinism).

Branch protection follow-up: drop `integration-test-ios` from the list of
required status checks. With the workflow change alone the job will still run
on every PR; branch protection removal is what actually prevents it from
blocking merges.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Targets the measured bottleneck: CocoaPods and Xcode build time.
- Keeps the coverage contract from ADR-005 intact while reducing feedback time.
- Avoids multiplying native build cost through premature sharding.
- Gives runner selection a measurable A/B path instead of relying on label
  assumptions.
- Daily execution cadence should keep dependency caches warm.

### Negative

- Tracking `Podfile` / `Podfile.lock` and adding native caches introduces CI
  maintenance overhead.
- `DerivedData` caching may consume multiple gigabytes and can evict other
  caches if keyed too broadly; cache version bumps may be required if cache
  pressure becomes visible.
- Runner image updates can invalidate Xcode-related caches unexpectedly.
- `macos-15` may not remain valid if dependencies begin requiring newer Xcode
  or iOS SDK symbols.

### Neutral

- This ADR does not change production code.
- This ADR does not change the coverage floors.
- The iOS integration job is downgraded to non-blocking telemetry. The
  aggregate floor stays at 89% because the iOS lcov was purely additive to
  the union (max hit-count per line).
