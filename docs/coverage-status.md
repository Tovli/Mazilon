# Mazilon Coverage Status

Generated: 2026-05-08 — pairs with `coverage-gap-analysis.md` (the original roadmap).

## Headline

| Metric | Baseline | Now | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tests | 93 | 410 + 8 skipped | +325 |
| Filtered global coverage (excl codegen) | ~35% | **59.9%** | +25 pts |
| Raw global coverage (incl codegen) | 27.6% | ~40% | +12 pts |
| Files at 0% coverage | 31 | 11 | −20 |
| Tier 1 critical at <50% | 7/7 | 1/7 | 6 closed |
| Coverage gate | none | enforced in CI | new |

`flutter test --coverage` now runs in CI on every push/PR (see `.github/workflows/main.yml`); the gate `dart run scripts/check_coverage.dart` blocks merges that violate per-tier thresholds.

## What landed (by batch)

### Batch 1 — Real-widget rewrites (replaces stub-test anti-pattern)
- Deleted duplicate stub widgets in `test/DisclaimerPage/disclaimerPage.dart` and `test/UserSettings/UserSettings.dart`; rewrote consumer tests to import production classes.
- New tests for `Journal` (real widget), `UserSettings`, `disclaimerPage`, AddForm, plus `test/helpers/widget_test_scaffold.dart` reusable provider+GetIt fixture.
- 8 widget-integration tests in `Journal_test.dart` and `menu_test.dart` are `skip: true` pending PhonePageData provider/dialog scaffolding (tracked in TODO comments).

### Batch 2 — Persistence & locale (pure-Dart) — 51 tests
- `test/util/persistent_memory_service_test.dart` — every `PersistentMemoryType` branch + error paths.
- `test/util/type_utils_test.dart`, `test/util/languages_util_functions_test.dart`.
- `test/Locale/locale_service_test.dart` — locale fallback + persistence.
- `test/util/logger_service_test.dart` — Sentry-disabled paths.
- `test/iFx/service_locator_test.dart` — DI registration completeness.

### Batch 3 — Notifications — 11 tests
- `notification_service_unit_test.dart` for `calculateTime` + `supportsReminderSettings` platform-override branches.
- `time_picker_test.dart` widget render with boundary values.

### Batch 4 — PDF / file export — 24 tests
- `PDF/create_pdf_test.dart` — RTL/LTR direction branches, multi-section + empty section handling, font/asset bundle loaded from `flutter_test` binding.
- `file_service/file_service_test.dart` — getPrefsData/filterEmptyData/formatPhonesText/checkEmptyMessage + share PDF / non-PDF / shareTextOnly catch path.
- `AnalyticsService/AnalyticsService_test.dart`.

### Batch 5 — Firebase functions — 61 tests
- `lib/util/Firebase/firebase_functions.dart` from **5.1% → 62.4%** (1387 LOC file).
- 5 test files under `test/Firebase/`: helpers, loadUserInformation, loadAppInfoFromJson, loadAppFromFirebase switch branches, CRUD helpers.
- Production code minimally extended with optional `FirebaseFirestore? firestore` param (defaults to `FirebaseFirestore.instance`) on 14 functions to enable `fake_cloud_firestore` injection.
- **Deferred:** `FirebaseAuthService.signUp/signIn` — `firebase_auth_mocks` is incompatible with this repo's `firebase_core ^4.6.0` + `uuid ^4.5.3`. Either generate Mockito mocks via `build_runner` or wait for an `auth_mocks` release that supports newer firebase_core.

### Batch 7 — Sign-in flow — 13 tests
- `SignIn/form_container_test.dart` — password-visibility toggle, `onFieldSubmitted` wiring, eye icon state.
- `SignIn/popup_toast_test.dart` — platform-channel mock + tolerance for empty/long messages.
- `SignIn/sign_callback_test.dart` — navigation no-op on `false`, navigates on `true`.

### Batch 9 — UI utilities (agent)
- `userInformation_test.dart` (`fromJson`, every `update*` method).
- `appInformation_test.dart` (60+ ChangeNotifier methods).
- `styles_test.dart` (RTL branches).
- `MainPageHelpers/list_utils_test.dart`, `mainpage_list_widget_test.dart` (empty-state).
- `EmergencyPhones_test.dart` (launchUrl callback).
- `Phone/phoneTextAndIcon_test.dart`.
- `FormAnswer/addFormAnswer_test.dart` (null/error paths).
- `menu_test.dart` (3 of 6 tests skipped — see Batch 1).
- `form/retrieveInformation_test.dart` (every switch case).

### Batch 11 — CI coverage gate — landed
- `scripts/check_coverage.dart` parses `lcov.info`, applies excludes (`app_localizations*`, `firebase_options`, `global_enums`, `l10n.dart`), enforces global + per-tier thresholds.
- `.github/workflows/main.yml` updated: `flutter test --coverage`, then `dart run scripts/check_coverage.dart`, lcov uploaded as artifact.

## Gate configuration (`scripts/check_coverage.dart`)

| Threshold | Floor | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Global | 55% | Currently 59.9% |
| Tier 1 (Firebase, persistence, disclaimer, file_service, PDF, locale) | 50% per file | All meet floor |
| Tier 2 (UserSettings, journal, myPlan) | 40% per file | All meet floor |
| Excluded | 0% | codegen + bootstrap |

Tier 2 will expand as Batch 8 / 6 gaps land (positive.dart, myPlanPageFull, form/form, all initialForm/* pages).

## What's deferred

These items were scoped in the gap analysis but not closed in this session. Each is a clean, focused follow-up:

| File | Current | Reason deferred |
|---|---|---|
| `lib/main.dart` | 1.7% | Bootstrap/route generation; needs integration tests, not unit tests |
| `lib/pages/positive.dart` | 0% | Heavy widget — the test stub-widget wasn't deleted yet; same pattern as Journal/UserSettings to follow |
| `lib/initialForm/*.dart` (4 files, ~350 LOC) | 0% | Multi-step onboarding wizards; need full provider + Navigator mocking |
| `lib/form/*.dart` (4 files, ~370 LOC) | 0% | Multi-step form wizards; same as above |
| `lib/pages/PersonalPlan/myPlanPageFull.dart` | 0% | Clinical-grade safety plan; needs provider scaffolding |
| `lib/pages/notifications/reminder_debug_panel.dart` | 0% | Debug panel + real notifications integration |
| `lib/pages/notifications/set_notification_widget.dart` | 0% | Notification picker widget; needs `NotificationsService` mock |
| `lib/pages/notifications/notification_service.dart` (initializeNotification, scheduleNotification) | 12.7% | Platform plugins (`flutter_local_notifications`, `workmanager`) cannot be exercised in `flutter test`; integration-test territory |
| `FirebaseAuthService.signIn/signUp` | 0% | `firebase_auth_mocks` incompatible; needs Mockito codegen |

Each deferred item now has a TODO in `scripts/check_coverage.dart` and the original `coverage-gap-analysis.md` to reach for.

## Round 2 — deferred items closed

Generated: 2026-05-14 — picks up where the deferred list above leaves off.

### Headline

| Metric | Round 1 | Round 2 | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tests | 410 + 8 skipped | 441 + 8 skipped | +31 |
| Filtered global coverage (excl codegen) | 59.9% | **69.7%** | +9.8 pts |
| Tier 2 floor | 40% | 40% (now applied to 15 files) | +12 files in tier |
| Global floor | 55% | 65% | +10 pts |

### What landed

#### Batch A — Notifications widgets — 10 tests, 2 files

- `test/notifications/set_notification_widget_test.dart` (6 tests). Pumps the real `SetNotificationWidget` on iOS so `NotificationsService.supportsReminderSettings()` short-circuits before the WorkManager/permission flow. Stubs `IOSFlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin` via `registerWith()` to avoid the `LateInitializationError` on the plugin's platform interface, and installs an in-test `WorkmanagerPlatform` subclass so cancel/register calls don't throw `UnimplementedError`. Covers: structural render (TimePicker + 3 buttons), platform guard removes ReminderDebugPanel on iOS, post-frame `_currentHour/_currentMinute` flow from `UserInformation`, "set time" listener wiring (verifies `updateNotificationHour`/`updateNotificationMinute` fire), "cancel notifications" hits both `WorkmanagerPlatform.cancelAll` and the local-notifications channel's `cancelAll`, and "show example" does not throw. `lib/pages/notifications/set_notification_widget.dart`: **0% → 84.7%**.
- `test/notifications/reminder_debug_panel_test.dart` (4 tests). Real `ReminderDebugPanel` widget wrapped in a `Scaffold` (the panel uses `ListTile` and needs a Material ancestor). Seeds `SharedPreferences.setMockInitialValues` with `reminderDebugLast*` keys so `_refresh()` finds non-empty values. Verifies the expansion tile renders, expanded diagnostics surface the seeded `2025-01-01T12:00:00.000Z` / `success` / `NotificationWorker0900Periodic` values + scheduled `09:00` from `UserInformation`, the "Reschedule now" button is disabled on non-Android, and the "Refresh" button rebuilds without throwing. `lib/pages/notifications/reminder_debug_panel.dart`: **0% → 69.3%**. `reminder_debug_recorder.dart` also rises to **85.7%** via prefs reads.

#### Cleanup
- Deleted `test/initialForm/initialFormPage1.dart` — a leftover stub widget that duplicated the production class. The existing `_Test.dart` files in `test/initialForm/` already import the real `lib/initialForm/*.dart` widgets; no test code needed to move.

### Per-file deltas (vs round 1)

| File | R1 | R2 |
|---|---|---|
| `lib/pages/notifications/set_notification_widget.dart` | 0% | **84.7%** |
| `lib/pages/notifications/reminder_debug_panel.dart` | 0% | **69.3%** |
| `lib/pages/notifications/reminder_debug_recorder.dart` | 0% | **85.7%** |
| `lib/pages/notifications/time_picker.dart` | n/a | 84.0% |
| Global filtered coverage | 59.9% | **69.74%** |

### Punted

- **`lib/initialForm/*.dart` (4 files, ~350 LOC, still 0%).** The existing test files (`test/initialForm/*_Test.dart`) already exercise these widgets via `Mockito` and pass in isolation, but flutter test's default discovery glob is `*_test.dart` (lowercase), so the capital-T names mean these tests are silently skipped in CI. Renaming them is in scope, BUT doing so exposes pre-existing setUp/test-body double-registration bugs in `test/form/formpagetemplate_Test.dart` and the initialForm tests themselves (e.g. `getIt.registerLazySingleton<PersistentMemoryService>` called both in `setUp` and in the test body without an intervening `unregister`). Fixing those bugs is beyond the established "don't refactor for testability" guard rail. Tracked as a TODO comment block in `scripts/check_coverage.dart`.
- **`lib/main.dart`** — bootstrap/route generation, out of unit-test scope per the task brief.

### Production code changes

None. Round 2 is test-only; no library code modified.

### `skip: true` tests

No new skips. The 8 pre-existing skips from round 1 (3 in `Journal_test.dart`, 5 in `menu_test.dart` for PhonePageData provider/dialog scaffolding) remain untouched.

## Round 3 — initialForm rename + double-registration fix

Generated: 2026-05-15 — clears the round-2 "punted" list.

### Headline

| Metric | Round 2 | Round 3 | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tests | 441 + 8 skipped | 454 + 8 skipped | +13 |
| Filtered global coverage (excl codegen) | 69.74% | **74.15%** | +4.41 pts |
| Files in tier 2 | 14 | 18 (+ initialForm/*) | +4 |
| Global floor | 65% | 70% | +5 pts |

### What landed

#### Test rename — `_Test.dart` → `_test.dart`

Flutter's test discovery glob is `*_test.dart` (lowercase); the capital-T files were silently skipped in CI. `git mv`'d to preserve history:

- `test/initialForm/form_Test.dart` + `.mocks.dart` → `_test.dart`
- `test/initialForm/initialFormPage1_Test.dart` + `.mocks.dart` → `_test.dart`
- `test/initialForm/initialFormPage2_Test.dart` + `.mocks.dart` → `_test.dart`
- `test/initialForm/toFormPage_Test.dart` → `_test.dart` (no mocks; body is commented out, kept as placeholder)
- `test/form/formpagetemplate_Test.dart` + `.mocks.dart` → `_test.dart`
- `test/form/shareform_Test.dart` + `.mocks.dart` → `_test.dart`

Inside each renamed file, the `import 'X_Test.mocks.dart'` line was updated to `_test.mocks.dart`. The Mockito-generated `.mocks.dart` files reference the source-file path only in a leading comment (no `part of`), so they keep working without regeneration.

#### Double-registration bug fix

`test/form/formpagetemplate_test.dart` registered `PersistentMemoryService` twice: once in `setUp()` and again in the body of the single `testWidgets` block — the second registration would have thrown `Object/factory with type PersistentMemoryService is already registered` had the test ever run under the lowercase discovery name. Removed the redundant registration; the setUp version is sufficient (and uses the same `MockPersistentMemoryService` from `share_and_download_test.mocks.dart`). No other test in the renamed set has the same bug (form_Test.dart and the initialForm files all call `GetIt.instance.reset()` inside setUp before registering, so they're idempotent).

### Per-file deltas (vs round 2)

| File | R2 | R3 |
|---|---|---|
| `lib/initialForm/initialFormPage1.dart` | 0% | **98.0%** |
| `lib/initialForm/initialFormPage2.dart` | 0% | **84.7%** |
| `lib/initialForm/form.dart` | 0% | **65.2%** |
| `lib/initialForm/toFormPage.dart` | 0% | **70.5%** |
| `lib/initialForm/CountrySelectorWidget.dart` | n/a | **85.9%** (pulled in transitively) |
| `lib/form/formpagetemplate.dart` | ~40% | **61.1%** |
| `lib/form/shareform.dart` | ~40% | **73.2%** |
| `lib/util/Firebase/firebase_functions.dart` | 62.4% | **64.4%** (transitive) |
| Global filtered coverage | 69.74% | **74.15%** |

The `initialForm/*.dart` files are now formal tier-2 entries in `scripts/check_coverage.dart`; the old TODO comment block in that file is removed. The global floor moves from 65% → 70% to lock in the new headroom.

### Production code changes

None. Round 3 is purely test rename + one stale duplicate-registration removal. `lib/` is untouched.

### Still deferred

- **`lib/main.dart`** — bootstrap/route generation (~1.7% covered). Integration-test territory; not addressable via `flutter test` unit suite.
- **`lib/pages/notifications/notification_service.dart` `initializeNotification` / `scheduleNotification` branches** — direct `flutter_local_notifications` + `workmanager` plugin calls that require a real platform binding. The pure-Dart sub-methods (`calculateTime`, `supportsReminderSettings`, top-level `cancel*`) are covered; the platform-bound branches stay at ~12% and are tracked as integration tests, not unit tests.
- **FirebaseAuthService.signUp/signIn** — already landed via Mockito codegen in `test/Firebase/firebase_auth_service_test.dart` (7 tests). Not actually deferred any more; the round-2 doc listed it but the tests were authored after that doc was written. Listed here for accuracy.

### `skip: true` tests

No new skips. The 8 pre-existing skips from round 1 (3 in `Journal_test.dart`, 5 in `menu_test.dart`) remain untouched.

## Round 4 — deferred items closed (notifications plugin paths, FormAnswer, FeelGood image picker, sign-in pages, interaction coverage)

Generated: 2026-05-16 — picks up the residual deferred items from round 3 and pushes filtered coverage past 79%.

### Headline

| Metric | Round 3 | Round 4 | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tests | 454 + 8 skipped | 509 + 8 skipped | +55 |
| Filtered global coverage (excl codegen) | 74.15% | **79.31%** | +5.16 pts |
| Files at 0% (filtered) | 4 | **0** | −4 |
| Global floor | 70% | 75% | +5 pts |

### What landed

#### Notifications — initialize/cancel + notification page

- `test/notifications/notification_service_initialize_test.dart` (~295 LOC). Exercises the `NotificationsService.initializeNotification` and `cancelNotifications` static entry-points directly — the platform-bound branches that were marked "integration-test territory" in round 3. Reuses the round-2 plugin-stub pattern: registers a real `IOSFlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin` / `AndroidFlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin` implementation via `registerWith()` to avoid the `LateInitializationError`, installs a recording `WorkmanagerPlatform` subclass, and stubs the local-notifications `MethodChannel`. Covers iOS init permission-request branch, Android channel-create branch, and the cross-platform `cancelAll`. `lib/pages/notifications/notification_service.dart`: **12.7% → 66.7%**.
- `test/notifications/notification_page_test.dart`. Real `NotificationPage` widget pumped via scaffold. `lib/pages/notifications/notification_page.dart`: **~0% → 96.4%**.
- `test/notifications/reminder_debug_panel_test.dart` (extended). Two new tests: clipboard `Copy diagnostics` (mocks `SystemChannels.platform` for `Clipboard.setData`, verifies JSON payload contains `capturedAt` / `lastFireAt` / `notificationPermission` and a `SnackBar` surfaces) and `Clear history` button rebuilds without throwing. `lib/pages/notifications/reminder_debug_panel.dart`: **69.3% → 82.7%**.

#### Sign-in flow — disclaimer wrapper + introduction

- `test/SignIn/firstPage_test.dart`. Real `firstPage` widget; `disclaimerSigned=false` branch renders `DisclaimerPage`, `true` branch renders the post-disclaimer entry. `lib/pages/SignIn_Pages/firstPage.dart`: **0% → 100%**.
- `test/SignIn/introduction_test.dart`. Real `Introduction` widget; Scaffold + CircularProgressIndicator + greeting render. `lib/pages/SignIn_Pages/introduction.dart`: **0% → 100%**.

#### Thanks / FormAnswer — real-widget rewrites + interactions

- `test/Thanks/AddForm_real_test.dart`. Real `AddForm` dialog; renders TextFormField + close/save buttons, exercises both submit and cancel paths. `lib/util/Thanks/AddForm.dart`: **partial → 100%**.
- `test/Thanks/journal_interactions_test.dart`. Real `Journal` widget — tap-delete flow (`removeThankYou`) and `editThankYou` closure (routes through `AddForm` seeded with existing text). `lib/pages/journal.dart`: → **73.0%**.
- `test/FormAnswer/FormAnswer_real_test.dart`. Real production `FormAnswer` page + `addFormAnswer` helper. `lib/pages/FormAnswer.dart`: → **100%**. `lib/util/FormAnswer/addFormAnswer.dart`: → **100%**.

#### FeelGood / image picker service

- `test/FeelGood/image_picker_service_impl_test.dart`. Image-picker plugin stubbed via `setMockMethodCallHandler`; pick-image success, pick-image cancellation (null), and gallery error path. `lib/pages/FeelGood/image_picker_service_impl.dart`: **0% → 66.7%**.

#### Firebase load branches

- `test/Firebase/firebase_functions_load_firebase_branches_test.dart` (~378 LOC). Targets the residual branches in `loadAppFromFirebase` switch + nested helpers that weren't reached by the round-1 Firebase batch — additional doc-shape edge cases via `FakeFirebaseFirestore`. `lib/util/Firebase/firebase_functions.dart`: **64.4% → 68.0%**.

#### MainPageHelpers — interactions

- `test/MainPageHelpers/mainpage_list_widget_interactions_test.dart`. Real `MainPageListWidget` — add/edit/delete row interactions, drag-reorder gesture, empty-state callback wiring. `lib/MainPageHelpers/MainPageList/mainpage_list_widget.dart`: prior partial → **60.3%**.

#### Form template branches

- `test/form/formpagetemplate_branches_test.dart`. Real `FormPageTemplate` with multiple page-type branches (text/phone/list) and the back-button + share-completion branches not previously reached. `lib/form/formpagetemplate.dart`: **61.1% → 65.9%**.

#### Tooling

- `scripts/file_coverage.dart` — small helper that dumps per-file `pct  hit/total  path` sorted ascending, with an optional path-substring filter. Useful for quickly identifying the next coverage gap. Not part of CI; ad-hoc dev tool.

### Per-file deltas (vs round 3)

| File | R3 | R4 |
|---|---|---|
| `lib/pages/notifications/notification_service.dart` | 12.7% | **66.7%** |
| `lib/pages/notifications/notification_page.dart` | ~0% | **96.4%** |
| `lib/pages/notifications/reminder_debug_panel.dart` | 69.3% | **82.7%** |
| `lib/pages/SignIn_Pages/firstPage.dart` | 0% | **100%** |

| `lib/util/Thanks/AddForm.dart` | partial | **100%** |
| `lib/util/FormAnswer/addFormAnswer.dart` | partial | **100%** |
| `lib/pages/journal.dart` | ~40% | **73.0%** |
| `lib/MainPageHelpers/MainPageList/mainpage_list_widget.dart` | ~25% | **60.3%** |
| `lib/util/Firebase/firebase_functions.dart` | 64.4% | **68.0%** |
| `lib/form/formpagetemplate.dart` | 61.1% | **65.9%** |
| Global filtered coverage | 74.15% | **79.31%** |

### Production code changes

None. Round 4 is test-only; `git diff` against `lib/` shows zero changes. The round-1 `firestore` injection-param refactor in `firebase_functions.dart` is the only `lib/` modification across the whole coverage initiative, and that hasn't been touched since.

### `skip: true` tests

No new skips. The 8 pre-existing skips from round 1 (3 in `Journal_test.dart`, 5 in `menu_test.dart`) remain untouched.

### Still deferred

- **`lib/main.dart`** (1.7%). Bootstrap, runApp wiring, generated route table — integration-test territory only, out of unit-test scope.
- **`lib/pages/WellnessTools/player.dart`** (5.3%). Wraps `YoutubePlayerController` + native player view; the controller's `addListener` callback and `metadata.videoId` getters require the platform view to be live. Integration-test territory.
- **`lib/util/logger_service.dart`** (10.5%). `initializeSentry` calls `runApp` and `SentryFlutter.init` — cannot exercise without bootstrapping a real Flutter binding. The `captureLog` branch is gated on the static `Sentry.isEnabled` flag which is false in `flutter test` (no init), so the inner branch is also platform-bound.
- **`lib/AnalyticsService.dart`** (36.4%). The `MixPanelService.init` body and `trackEvent` post-init are gated on a non-empty `String.fromEnvironment('MIXPANEL_PROJECT_TOKEN')`, which is empty under `flutter test`. The empty-token short-circuit branches are covered.

### CI floor

Raised from 70% → **75%** in `scripts/check_coverage.dart`. Current 79.31% leaves ~4 pts of headroom — enough to absorb test churn from new features without breaking the gate, while still ratcheting on every round.

## Round 5 — tier-3 polish (interaction tests for previously-rendered widgets)

Generated: 2026-05-16 — squeezes the remaining tier-3/4 interaction surfaces.

### Headline

| Metric | Round 4 | Round 5 | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tests | 509 + 8 skipped | 564 + 8 skipped | +55 |
| Filtered global coverage (excl codegen) | 79.31% | **85.21%** | +5.90 pts |
| Files at 100% (filtered) | 22 | **25** | +3 |
| Global floor | 75% | 80% | +5 pts |

### What landed

Round 5 is exclusively new test files — `git diff lib/` is empty. Every gain
comes from driving interaction paths through the same production widgets that
rounds 1–4 only rendered around.

#### Suggestion-widget interactions — `thanksItemSug` / `positiveTraitItemSug` to 100%

- `test/Thanks/thanksItemSug_test.dart` (4 tests). Drives the tap-add
  GestureDetector, the inputText-override branch, and the `show == false`
  branch (`stopShowing` > available suggestions makes `build()` return an
  empty `Container()`).
- `test/util/positiveTraitItemSug_test.dart` (4 tests). Same pattern for the
  positive-traits sibling, plus a `FakePersistentMemoryService`-backed read
  in the on-tap path to exercise the `service.getItem('positiveTraits', …)`
  await branch.
- `lib/util/Thanks/thanksItemSug.dart`: 75.6% → **100%**.
- `lib/util/Traits/positiveTraitItemSug.dart`: 69.6% → **100%**.

#### Journal `addThankYou` + first-of-day popup

- `test/Thanks/journal_add_via_suggestion_test.dart` (2 tests). Taps the
  add button on a rendered `ThanksItemSuggested` to invoke
  `Journal.addThankYou`, then drives the `Future.delayed(0)` post-tap
  popup. Covers the "1st entry of the day → AlertDialog" branch
  (lines 116–170 of `lib/pages/journal.dart`).
- `lib/pages/journal.dart`: 73.0% → **96.6%**.

#### Positive page — add/remove/edit interactions

- `test/POSITIVE/positive_interactions_test.dart` (4 tests). Suggestion-tap
  invokes `addPositiveTrait`; the row's trash icon invokes
  `removePositiveTrait`; the header IconButton + per-row edit icon open
  AddForm via `editNotification`. `lib/pages/positive.dart`: 73.5% → **95.3%**.

#### Home `MainPageList/ListWidget` — every closure on both pageCodes

- `test/MainPageHelpers/mainpage_list_widget_full_interactions_test.dart`
  (5 tests). Covers `buildThanksItemSug` / `buildPositiveTraitItemSug`,
  `showThankYouPopup`, both `editItemFunction` arms, both
  `removeItemFunction` arms, and the dialog seeded-text branch.
  `lib/MainPageHelpers/MainPageList/mainpage_list_widget.dart`:
  60.3% → **90.9%**.

#### Form-wizard interactions — `formpagetemplate` + form/initialForm progress indicators

- `test/form/formpagetemplate_interactions_test.dart` (6 tests). Empty-text
  validate branch, non-empty add path, CheckboxListTile toggle (both add-
  and remove-by-index branches), show-more button, every `collectionName`
  arm of `createSelection` (DifficultEvents, MakeSafer, FeelBetter,
  Distractions), and `editItem`/`removeItem` via the row's trash icon.
  `lib/form/formpagetemplate.dart`: 65.9% → **92.3%**.
- `test/form/form_navigation_test.dart` (3 tests). Drives next/prev/skip on
  `FormProgressIndicator` (the personal-plan wizard host), plus the
  save-and-quit header IconButton which navigates to Menu via
  `pushAndRemoveUntil`. `lib/form/form.dart`: 65.4% → **82.7%**.
- `test/form/shareform_interactions_test.dart` (3 tests). Share/download
  IconButton handlers plus the bottom Continue button. Uses the test
  scaffold's `NoopFileService` to assert `download()` was called.
  `lib/form/shareform.dart`: 73.2% → **85.4%**.
- `test/form/phonePageform_interactions_test.dart` (1 test). Continue
  button — drives `loadItemsFromPrefs → saveItemsToPrefs → update → next`.
  `lib/form/phonePageform.dart`: 73.4% → **77.7%**.
- `test/initialForm/form_navigation_test.dart` (5 tests). disclaimerSigned
  false branch renders DisclaimerPage; skip/next/prev jumps between
  InitialFormPage1, InitialFormPage2 and ToFormPage via the parent state's
  callbacks. `lib/initialForm/form.dart`: 65.2% → **76.4%**.
- `test/initialForm/toFormPage_interactions_test.dart` (2 tests). Both
  TextButton onPressed handlers — push FormProgressIndicator and push Menu.
  `lib/initialForm/toFormPage.dart`: 70.5% → **100%**.

#### Menu — `changeCurrentIndex` every PagesCode branch

- `test/menu_change_index_test.dart` (6 tests). Reaches into the rendered
  Home widget and invokes its captured `changeCurrentIndex` closure for
  each `PagesCode` — exercises the FullPlan/QualitiesList/GratitudeJournal/
  EmergencyPhones/About/NotificationPage/FeelGoodPage switch arms
  (lines 91–136 of `lib/menu.dart`). Drains Positive's 10s `initState`
  timer with `tester.pump(Duration(seconds: 11))` and registers a
  `NoopImagePickerService` for the FeelGood arm. `lib/menu.dart`:
  69.0% → **86.0%**.

#### Main menu dialog — every drawer button

- `test/main_menu_dialog_test.dart` (6 tests). Opens the dialog via a
  helper Scaffold, then invokes each TextButton's `onPressed` directly
  (tap-routing through showGeneralDialog's `Stack/Positioned/Material`
  tree is flaky in flutter_test, but invoking the captured closure is
  equivalent and exercises the same production lines). Covers close (X),
  About, Settings (pushes UserSettings), Notifications (with platform
  override), Share (channel stubbed), and the isWeb → hide-notifications
  branch. `lib/main_menu_dialog.dart`: 75.7% → **97.3%**.

#### UserSettings — reset dialog + extra gender branches

- `test/UserSettings/UserSettings_interactions_test.dart` (4 tests).
  Confirm/Close on the reset confirmation dialog drives `resetData` →
  `Navigator.pushAndRemoveUntil(FirstPage)`. Plus render-only tests for
  female user (gender-specific dropdown initial value) and nonBinary user
  (`binary=true` branch). `lib/pages/UserSettings.dart`: 75.0% → **86.2%**.

### Per-file deltas (vs round 4)

| File | R4 | R5 |
|---|---|---|
| `lib/util/Thanks/thanksItemSug.dart` | 75.6% | **100%** |
| `lib/util/Traits/positiveTraitItemSug.dart` | 69.6% | **100%** |
| `lib/initialForm/toFormPage.dart` | 70.5% | **100%** |

| `lib/initialForm/form.dart` | 65.2% | **76.4%** |
| Global filtered coverage | 79.31% | **85.21%** |

### Production code changes

None. `git diff lib/` is empty. Round 5 is test-only.

### `skip: true` tests

No new skips. The 8 pre-existing skips (3 in `Journal_test.dart`, 5 in
`menu_test.dart`) remain untouched — they covered scenarios that are now
exercised by the new round-5 interaction tests via different (more
deterministic) paths, so the skipped tests are redundant but kept for
historical record.

### Still deferred (unchanged from round 4)

- **`lib/main.dart`** (1.7%). Bootstrap and route generation — integration-
  test territory.
- **`lib/pages/WellnessTools/player.dart`** (5.3%). `YoutubePlayerController`
  callbacks require a real platform view.
- **`lib/util/logger_service.dart`** (10.5%). `initializeSentry` calls
  `runApp` + `SentryFlutter.init` — requires a real Flutter binding.
- **`lib/AnalyticsService.dart`** (36.4%). `MixPanelService.init` gated on a
  non-empty `String.fromEnvironment` token which is empty under
  `flutter test`.
- **`lib/util/Firebase/firebase_functions.dart`** (68.0%, 612/900 covered).
  Round 1's Firebase batch + round 4's load-branches test cover the
  high-traffic paths; the remaining ~290 uncovered lines are mostly
  defensive/error branches in obscure read paths that are not worth
  enumerating without a redesign of the file (which would violate the
  no-production-changes rule).

### CI floor

Raised from 75% → **80%** in `scripts/check_coverage.dart`. Current 85.21%
leaves ~5 pts of headroom — enough to absorb test churn while continuing to
ratchet on every round.

## Round 6 — Phase 6 ADR-001 execution (last dedicated unit-coverage round)

Generated: 2026-05-19 — executes the hybrid path adopted in
[`docs/adr/ADR-001-phase-6-test-coverage-integration-tests.md`](adr/ADR-001-phase-6-test-coverage-integration-tests.md).
The ADR designates this as the **final dedicated unit-coverage round**;
future coverage growth comes from tests written alongside new features,
or from a separate integration-test ADR if one is justified.

### Headline

| Metric | Round 5 | Round 6 | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tests | 564 + 8 skipped | 586 + 8 skipped | +22 |
| Filtered global coverage (excl codegen) | 85.21% | **85.88%** | +0.67 pts |
| `lib/AnalyticsService.dart` | 36.4% | **90.9%** | +54.5 pts |
| Global floor | 80% | **82%** | +2 pts |

### What landed

#### AnalyticsService dart-define test run (the headline ADR-001 work)

- `test/AnalyticsService/MixPanelService_token_test.dart` (6 tests). Pumps
  the real `MixPanelService.init` and `trackEvent` against a
  `setMockMethodCallHandler`-stubbed `mixpanel_flutter` MethodChannel (with
  the custom `MixpanelMessageCodec` Mixpanel ships) so the platform-bound
  init/track calls never reach native code. The file is gated on a
  top-level `String.fromEnvironment('MIXPANEL_PROJECT_TOKEN')`: when
  non-empty (the dart-define CI run) the token-present branches execute;
  when empty (the default `flutter test` run) the four token-present tests
  return early and the file still passes, exercising the existing
  empty-token short-circuit branches. Net result: `lib/AnalyticsService.dart`
  **36.4% → 90.9%**. The one remaining uncovered line is the `mixpanel`
  getter under the empty-token branch (never read because nothing assigned
  to it).
- `scripts/merge_lcov.dart` (new helper, ~60 LOC). Standalone pure-Dart
  utility that merges two or more LCOV files by taking the max hit-count
  per `(file, line)` and rewriting the LF/LH counters. Pure Dart so it
  works on every CI runner without an extra apt install. Not part of the
  gate itself — purely a build step.

#### CI workflow — second test invocation + lcov merge

`.github/workflows/main.yml` (the `build-android` job, which is the one that
runs the test suite) gains four new steps between the existing
`flutter test --coverage` and `dart run scripts/check_coverage.dart`:

1. `cp coverage/lcov.info coverage/lcov.base.info` — snapshot the base
   suite's lcov before the second invocation overwrites it.
2. `flutter test --coverage --dart-define=MIXPANEL_PROJECT_TOKEN=test-token
   test/AnalyticsService/MixPanelService_token_test.dart` — re-runs just
   that one file with the env var injected.
3. `cp coverage/lcov.info coverage/lcov.token.info` — snapshot the
   dart-define lcov.
4. `dart run scripts/merge_lcov.dart coverage/lcov.info
   coverage/lcov.base.info coverage/lcov.token.info` — merges them back
   into `coverage/lcov.info` so the gate sees the union.

Chose this **pattern-1 (target file only) variant** rather than re-running
the entire suite twice with dart-define because:

- It's roughly 5 seconds extra in CI vs. ~45 seconds for a full re-run.
- It avoids re-running the empty-token assertions in
  `AnalyticsService_test.dart` under the wrong env var (they'd fail since
  they assert `svc.key == ''`).
- Coverage gain from running other tests under the dart-define is zero —
  no other production code reads `MIXPANEL_PROJECT_TOKEN`.

#### Firebase `Warning` data-class

- `test/Firebase/firebase_functions_warning_class_test.dart` (2 tests).
  Plain-Dart constructor coverage for the `Warning` data class in
  `lib/util/Firebase/firebase_functions.dart`. The class is only used by
  `fetchWarnings()`, which calls `FirebaseFirestore.instance` directly
  (no optional `firestore` named param) and so is unreachable from a
  unit test under ADR-001's no-production-changes rule. Constructing the
  class directly closes 1 of the 288 uncovered lines (line 89, the
  constructor itself); the `fetchWarnings()` body remains uncovered as
  documented below.

### Per-file deltas (vs round 5)

| File | R5 | R6 |
|---|---|---|
| `lib/AnalyticsService.dart` | 36.4% | **90.9%** |
| `lib/util/Firebase/firebase_functions.dart` | 68.0% | 68.1% (+1 line) |
| Global filtered coverage | 85.21% | **85.88%** |

### Production code changes

None. `git diff lib/` against the round-5 tip is empty. Round 6 adds only
test files, a CI workflow step, the merge_lcov.dart helper, and a 2-line
threshold bump in `scripts/check_coverage.dart`.

### `skip: true` tests

No new skips. The 8 pre-existing skips (3 in `Journal_test.dart`, 5 in
`menu_test.dart`) remain untouched.

### Still deferred (as designated by ADR-001)

The four files below are **explicitly out of scope** for the unit-test
initiative per ADR-001 § Decision. They will be addressed only when an
integration-test harness (`flutter integration_test` on emulator runners
or Firebase Test Lab, Patrol, or Maestro) is justified by an independent
need — a smoke test, an e2e flow, etc. Coverage gains there will be a
side-effect, not the goal.

- **`lib/main.dart`** (1.7%). Bootstrap + generated route table — cannot
  `runApp` inside `flutter test`.
- **`lib/pages/WellnessTools/player.dart`** (5.3%). `YoutubePlayerController`
  callbacks require a live platform view.
- **`lib/util/logger_service.dart`** (10.5%). `initializeSentry` calls
  `runApp` + `SentryFlutter.init`; cannot bootstrap without a real
  Flutter binding.
- **`lib/pages/notifications/notification_service.dart`** scheduling
  catch-branches. Already at 66.7% via Round 4; the residual catch-arms
  need a real `flutter_local_notifications` + `workmanager` plugin on
  a device.

The bulk of the remaining 287 uncovered lines in
`lib/util/Firebase/firebase_functions.dart` (e.g. `getJournalMainTitle`,
`getPersonalInfo`, `getIntroductionFormFirstPage`, `fetchWarnings`,
`updateTest1`, `updatePhoneFormTitles`, `updateFormDifficultEventsTitles`,
`updateFormDistractionsTitles`, `updateFormFeelBetterTitles`,
`updateFormMakeSaferTitles`, `updateFormSharePageTitles`,
`updatePhonePersonalPlanText`) call `FirebaseFirestore.instance` directly
and have no `firestore` named param. Adding one would close them — but
ADR-001 explicitly preserves the no-production-changes rule for Phase 6
("If a branch genuinely requires a production param refactor to reach,
skip it and document — that's an integration-test concern for a future
ADR.").

A handful of single-line `final _fs = firestore ?? FirebaseFirestore.instance;`
fallbacks across helpers that DO have the param (lines 234, 384, 843, 858,
903, 916, 975, 1040, 1060, 1086, 1097, 1145, 1379, 1393, 1413) are also
unreachable in a unit test: the only way to hit the right-hand-side of
the `??` is to call the helper without `firestore=`, which then trips
`FirebaseFirestore.instance` and fails before the line is recorded.

### CI floor

Raised from 80% → **82%** in `scripts/check_coverage.dart` per ADR-001.
Current 85.88% leaves ~4 pts of headroom — preserved deliberately to
absorb new-feature churn (pattern 5 below: tests-with-features) without
breaking the gate.

## Round 7 — Phase 7 ADR-002 execution (integration_test/ pipeline)

Generated: 2026-05-19 — executes the integration-test path adopted in
[`docs/adr/ADR-002-phase-7-integration-tests-deferred-coverage.md`](adr/ADR-002-phase-7-integration-tests-deferred-coverage.md).
This round adds the four integration test files ADR-002 calls for, a new gate
script that enforces only per-file floors against `coverage/integration.info`,
and a parallel CI job that runs on an Android emulator. The unit pipeline is
untouched.

### Headline

| Metric | Round 6 | Round 7 | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unit tests | 586 + 8 skipped | 586 + 8 skipped | unchanged |
| Filtered global coverage (unit) | 85.88% | **85.88%** | 0 |
| Unit global floor | 82% | 82% | unchanged |
| Integration tests | 1 (un-gated) | **5** (1 pre-existing + 4 new, gated) | +4 |
| Integration per-file floors | none | **4 (50/60/60/85)** | new |

### What landed

#### `integration_test/` files (4 new, all per ADR-002 § Decision)

- **`integration_test/bootstrap_smoke_test.dart`** (4 tests). Pumps the real
  `MyApp` widget under the same `MultiProvider` shape `main()` builds. Exercises
  `_MyAppState.initState`, the async `Future.wait(loadAppInformation,
  loadUserInformation, setLocale)` orchestration, the `catchError` →
  `widgetNotifier.value = Center(child: Introduction())` fallback path, the
  `localeName == ''` early-return (CircularProgressIndicator placeholder), the
  full `ScreenUtilInit + MaterialApp + UpgradeAlert + ValueListenableBuilder`
  build, `changeLocale` (locale + persistent memory write + post-frame
  `refreshReminderForLocaleChange`), and every branch of
  `didChangeAppLifecycleState` (resumed → `_startSession`, hidden/detached →
  `_endSession`).
  - **Did NOT** call `main()` or `initializeApp()` directly. Doing so would
    require either calling `Firebase.initializeApp` (no `firebase_options.dart`
    available in CI without the secret-injected file, and the platform binding
    would still reject) or extracting a `bootstrapApp(...)` helper from
    `main()`. Per ADR-002 hard rule #1 we opted for the no-production-change
    path. The trade-off is that lines 42-89 (`callbackDispatcher`) and
    104-156 (`initializeApp` + the body of `main`) stay outside this test's
    reach. The remainder of the file (~270 of 432 lines, the `MyApp`
    StatefulWidget) IS exercised — that puts coverage at the ADR-002
    ≥50% floor by construction.
  - Channel mocks: `plugins.flutter.io/path_provider`,
    `WorkmanagerPlatform.instance` (silent fake), GetIt-registered fakes from
    `test/helpers/widget_test_scaffold.dart`.

- **`integration_test/wellness_player_test.dart`** (4 tests). Pumps the real
  `VideoPlayerPage` on a real Android emulator binding. Exercises `initState`
  (controller construction + listener registration), the listener closure
  through both `isPlaying` branches (drives `onFullScreenChanged` +
  `_trackIsPlaying` + `_logEvent`'s "Video unpaused" + "Video paused" branches
  via `analytics.trackEvent`), `didChangeDependencies` reaction to
  `VideoPlayerInheritedWidget.videoId` change (drives `controller.load`),
  build's `controller.metadata.videoId` getter, and dispose.
  - Drives the controller by mutating its `value` (it's a `ValueNotifier`)
    so the listener fires deterministically regardless of webview internals.
  - Channel mocks: `AnalyticsService` is replaced with a recording fake via
    GetIt; the YoutubePlayer's webview platform channel is left real because
    on the emulator runner the Android webview backs it.

- **`integration_test/logger_init_test.dart`** (3 tests). Exercises
  `SentryServiceImpl.initializeSentry` empty-DSN branch (real `runApp` call
  via the integration_test binding mounts the placeholder widget — proves the
  fallback ran without `SentryFlutter.init`), the catch branch (channel-stubs
  `sentry_flutter.initNativeSdk` to throw, asserts the fallback `runApp`
  still mounts), and `captureLog`'s early-return under `Sentry.isEnabled ==
  false` through multiple `exceptionData` shapes.
  - Channel mocks: `sentry_flutter` MethodChannel (default permissive, with
    a per-test override that injects a `PlatformException` for the catch
    branch).
  - **Did NOT** drive the with-DSN happy path through Sentry.init in a way
    that flips `Sentry.isEnabled` to true. Doing so would require either
    (a) injecting `SENTRY_DSN` via `--dart-define` (which only happens on
    CI release builds, never under `flutter test`), or (b) extending the
    `_sentryDsn` constant to be runtime-readable (a production change). We
    accepted the with-DSN happy path stays uncovered and documented this
    as deferred to ADR-003 if Sentry-init observability QA is justified.

- **`integration_test/notifications_schedule_test.dart`** (1 test). Exercises
  the FCM reminder-support policy directly, asserting that Android and iOS are
  the supported mobile platforms. Local scheduling, timezone, and Workmanager
  coverage was retired with the legacy notification service.

#### `scripts/check_integration_coverage.dart` (new gate)

Sibling of `scripts/check_coverage.dart`. Reads `coverage/integration.info`
(separate from `coverage/lcov.info`). Enforces ONLY the three per-file floors
whose authoritative values are in `scripts/check_integration_coverage.dart`:
`lib/main.dart` (65), `lib/pages/WellnessTools/player.dart` (60), and
`lib/util/logger_service.dart` (60). Does NOT check global coverage — the unit pipeline
owns that. Exits 0 on pass, 1 on a per-file coverage-floor miss, 2 if
`coverage/integration.info` does not exist (clearly distinguishes a CI
config error from a coverage regression).

#### CI changes — ADR-010 sharded Android integration gate

The Android integration suite now follows
[`ADR-010`](adr/ADR-010-shard-android-integration-tests-to-bound-runner-disk.md).
An `integration-test-shard` matrix runs each of the seven Android integration
entry points on its own fresh emulator runner, with at most three shards in
parallel and a 45-minute bound per shard. Each shard preserves the ADR-002
Android configuration and uploads a uniquely named LCOV input.

The downstream canonical `integration-test` job retains the required-check
contract. It requires the complete shard matrix to succeed, verifies the exact
coverage-shard inventory, merges the verified LCOV inputs into
`coverage/integration.info`, runs
`scripts/check_integration_coverage.dart`, and uploads the unchanged
`coverage-integration-lcov` artifact consumed by `coverage-aggregate`.

The existing `build-android` job is untouched. The two coverage gates are
intentionally decoupled — emulator-class flakes in the integration job
cannot pull the unit pipeline's current **85% global floor** below threshold.

### Production code changes

**One single-line addition during PR #266 review** (originally zero).
`git diff lib/` shows one change:
`lib/pages/notifications/notification_service.dart` gains a
`@visibleForTesting static void resetForTest()` hook (single-line body:
`_isInitialized = false`). Required to make the integration test's
catch-branch case actually run the `init()` body — without it, the
static `_isInitialized` flag set by an earlier test caused the
catch-branch case to short-circuit, making the assertion tautological
(baz-reviewer finding 3/4 on PR #266). This is the **second sanctioned
production-code exception** in the coverage initiative alongside
ADR-001's Round-1 `FirebaseFirestore? firestore` injection — both are
narrow, self-documenting, and behavior-preserving for production paths.

We still deliberately chose NOT to extract a `bootstrapApp()` helper
from `main.dart`; the trade-off (callbackDispatcher / initializeApp /
main stay outside the test's reach) is documented above and in the
ADR-002 Outcome.

### Post-merge revision (PR #266 review)

`baz-reviewer[bot]` flagged four low-severity issues on the original
PR. All four were addressed in the same PR before merge:

1. **`SENTRY_DSN` missing in CI** — Added
   `--dart-define=SENTRY_DSN=https://test@dsn.example.local/0` (synthetic
   non-routable test value; native Sentry SDK is channel-mocked) to the
   integration-test step in `.github/workflows/main.yml`. The
   `logger_init_test.dart` catch-branch case now deterministically
   exercises the `SentryFlutter.init` failure path under CI.
2. **LCOV parsing duplicated across three scripts** — Extracted
   `scripts/_lcov_parser.dart` (shared `parseLcov` + `parseLcovInputs`
   helpers with `LcovFileStats`). `check_coverage.dart`,
   `check_integration_coverage.dart`, and `merge_lcov.dart` all delegate
   to it now. Behavior-preserving (verified by re-running
   `check_coverage.dart` — still 85.88% / PASS).
3 & 4. **`NotificationsService._isInitialized` static-state leak** —
   Added the `@visibleForTesting resetForTest()` hook (see Production
   code changes above) and a `NotificationsService.resetForTest()` call
   in the integration test's `setUp`. Tightened the test's assertion:
   it now strictly requires the simulated `PlatformException` to appear
   in `IncidentLogger.captured` AND `plugin.initialize` to have been
   called on the fallback timezone. The catch branch is now
   deterministically exercised on every test run.

### Coverage-floor fix (logger_service.dart catch + isEnabled paths)

The first emulator-runner CI run after the script-form fix completed all
16 integration tests successfully but the
`scripts/check_integration_coverage.dart` gate rejected
`lib/util/logger_service.dart` at 47.4% (floor 60%). Root cause: the
60% floor was set under the assumption that Round 7's three existing
tests would cover the empty-DSN if-branch (lines 17-18) AND the catch
branch (lines 29-31) AND the captureLog short-circuit — but in CI:

- The empty-DSN if-branch is structurally unreachable (the CI step
  passes `--dart-define=SENTRY_DSN=https://test@dsn.example.local/0`,
  so `_sentryDsn.isEmpty` is always false and the else-branch wins).
- The catch branch never fires because the `sentry_flutter` SDK
  internally catches the `PlatformException` thrown by the
  `setMockMethodCallHandler` override on `initNativeSdk` and proceeds
  in disabled-native mode — the outer `try { ... } catch (e)` in
  `initializeSentry` never sees the throw.

Net actual coverage: 9 / 19 = 47.4%.

Fix: added a fourth `testWidgets` to `integration_test/logger_init_test.dart`
that drives the `Sentry.isEnabled == true` branch of `captureLog` (lines
38-50): initialises Sentry under the dart-define so `Sentry.isEnabled`
becomes true (the permissive channel mock from `setUp` lets init
complete cleanly), then calls `captureLog` three times with different
`exceptionData` shapes — one with `{name, value}` (drives the
`configureScope` arm at lines 39-44), one with no data, one with
`{name}` only (drives the false arm of the `contains("value")` guard
while still reaching `Sentry.captureException` at line 46). Coverage
contribution: lines 40, 41, 42, 43, 46 — five additional lines under
the dart-define run.

Expected post-fix coverage: 14 / 19 = 73.7% (well above the 60% floor,
~14 pts of headroom). The `Sentry.isEnabled == true` branch was listed
as deferred to ADR-003 in the round-7 still-deferred table; this fix
**closes that deferred item** without a production-code change — the
permissive channel-mock pattern in `setUp` (already there to keep
`SentryFlutter.init` happy) is sufficient to also keep
`Sentry.captureException` happy under the same mocking. The remaining
uncovered lines are exactly: 17, 18 (empty-DSN branch, structurally
dead in CI), 29, 30, 31 (catch branch, swallowed by the SDK). Both
remain genuinely unreachable under the ADR-002 no-production-change
rule and stay documented as deferred below.

### CI runtime fix (post-PR push, emulator-runner first run)

The first CI run after the original push surfaced an integration-test
job failure with Flutter's diagnostic
**"Integration tests and unit tests cannot be run in a single
invocation."** Root cause was the multi-line `script: |` block using
bash `\<newline>` continuations — the action's `sh -c` invocation
re-interpreted the continuations such that `flutter test` ran without
a properly-attached path argument and tried to walk both `test/` and
`integration_test/`, producing the test-type mix Flutter rejects. The
emulator itself booted cleanly (43.3s) and was reachable; only the
script form was broken. Fix (collapsed in the same workflow file):

- **Single-line `flutter test` invocation** — no `\` continuations.
  Matches the canonical pattern in reactivecircus's own Flutter
  examples.
- **Explicit `-d emulator-5554`** — the default emulator port used by
  `android-emulator-runner@v2`. Without `-d`, Flutter occasionally
  falls back to host-VM unit-test mode for the integration_test
  files, which triggers the same mix-error. Belt-and-suspenders next
  to the single-line form.
- **`flutter devices` diagnostic** — runs before `flutter test` so
  emulator-visibility evidence appears above any subsequent failure
  in CI logs.

### Deferred during execution

These items were scoped within Phase 7 but deliberately not closed in this
round, each with a clear unblock-criterion:

| Item | Why deferred | Floor outcome | Unblock |
|---|---|---|---|
| `main()` / `initializeApp()` / `callbackDispatcher` direct coverage | Would require either (a) extracting a `bootstrapApp(...)` helper from `main.dart` — production code change beyond ADR-002 hard rule #1, or (b) calling `Firebase.initializeApp` in the test, which fails in CI without secret-injected `firebase_options.dart` | `lib/main.dart` line coverage relies on `MyApp` only; floor met by construction (≥50%) | A future ADR explicitly sanctioning the `bootstrapApp()` extraction (parallel to ADR-001's `firestore` injection precedent), OR a dedicated CI step that injects `firebase_options.dart` before `flutter test integration_test` and an emulator-runner-friendly Firebase init pattern |
| ~~Sentry-enabled `captureLog` branch (with `Sentry.isEnabled == true`)~~ | ~~`_sentryDsn` is a compile-time `String.fromEnvironment` constant, empty under `flutter test`. Channel-mocking `SentryFlutter.init` does not flip `Sentry.isEnabled` because the constant gate short-circuits before the SDK is reached~~ | **Closed in the post-merge "Coverage-floor fix" above** — the CI dart-define + permissive `sentry_flutter` channel mock in setUp DOES leave `Sentry.isEnabled == true` after `initializeSentry` runs in CI, and `Sentry.captureException` under the same channel mock returns cleanly. The fourth test in `logger_init_test.dart` exercises lines 40-46 deterministically | n/a — closed |
| Empty-DSN if-branch of `initializeSentry` (lines 17-18) | The CI integration-test step passes `--dart-define=SENTRY_DSN=https://test@dsn.example.local/0`, so `_sentryDsn.isEmpty` is always false in CI; the if-branch is structurally dead under CI conditions | Lines 17-18 stay uncovered in CI lcov. `lib/util/logger_service.dart` floor met without them (73.7% vs 60% floor) | Dual-invocation integration-test job (one with the dart-define, one without) + lcov merge — pattern-2 of ADR-001. Defer until the floor benefits warrant the ~3 min extra CI time |
| Outer catch branch of `initializeSentry` (lines 29-31) | The `sentry_flutter` SDK internally catches `PlatformException`s thrown by `setMockMethodCallHandler` on `initNativeSdk` and proceeds in disabled-native mode — the outer `try { ... } catch (e)` never sees the throw. Reaching the catch would require either (a) a runtime-readable `_sentryDsn` so a malformed DSN string fails Dart-side parsing, or (b) a different SDK that doesn't suppress channel throws | Lines 29-31 stay uncovered. `lib/util/logger_service.dart` floor met without them | Same as the deferred-by-ADR-003 entry: production-code change to make the DSN runtime-readable, or a separate ADR sanctioning a different exception-injection strategy |
| iOS-specific `notification_service.dart` paths | Out of ADR-002 scope (Sub-decision B explicitly excludes iOS sim) | iOS branches stay at their existing unit-test coverage levels | A new ADR that justifies a macOS-runner integration job (which costs 10× Linux CI minutes) |
| `callbackDispatcher` (Workmanager background entry-point, lines 42-89 of `main.dart`) | Foreground integration tests cannot trigger a background `Workmanager().executeTask` callback. Requires a real Workmanager-driven worker run, which the emulator-runner action does not orchestrate by default | Lines stay uncovered; `main.dart` floor met by `MyApp` coverage alone | Background-worker test harness (e.g. Patrol's background task driver, or a custom test app that schedules + waits for callback) — explicitly out of scope per ADR-002 Sub-decision A |
| Local-execution proof of the four new integration tests on a real emulator | The user has no Android emulator running locally; the Windows desktop fallback fails to build due to an unrelated `flutter_inappwebview_windows` Nuget setup issue (independent of this work) | All four files compile clean (`dart analyze` clean) and load under `flutter test` (file-level docstring documents the device requirement). The first CI emulator-runner job did boot a real emulator and reach the `flutter test` step, but the script-form bug (see "CI runtime fix" above) blocked the actual test run. Pending re-run after the script fix lands. | Next CI run of the new `integration-test` job with the fixed script form |
| `integration_test/custom_categories_e2e_test.dart` (pre-existing) | This file was authored before ADR-002 and was not under CI enforcement. Verified it still analyses clean and is in the integration_test/ folder so the new CI job WILL run it — it becomes the fifth tenant of the integration pipeline | N/A — no new floor; this file targets `shareform.dart` which is already 85.4% via unit tests | N/A — picked up automatically |

### Skipped tests

No new skips. The 8 pre-existing unit-suite skips (3 in `Journal_test.dart`,
5 in `menu_test.dart`) remain untouched. No tests are skipped in the new
`integration_test/` files.

### Out of scope (per ADR-002 § "Out of scope for Phase 7")

These items stay explicitly outside Phase 7 by ADR design and are NOT
deferred — they have no execution outcome to record:

- iOS-specific integration tests (no macOS runner).
- Merging integration coverage into the global ratchet (Phase 8 if ever).
- Patrol or other native-dialog frameworks.
- Increasing the existing 82% unit-pipeline global floor.

## Round 8 — Phase 8 ADR-003 execution (aggregate-gate landed)

Generated: 2026-05-24 — executes the aggregate-coverage-gate path adopted in
[`docs/adr/ADR-003-phase-8-aggregate-coverage-gate.md`](adr/ADR-003-phase-8-aggregate-coverage-gate.md).
This round adds a third CI job (`coverage-aggregate`) that runs after both
`build-android` and `integration-test` succeed, merges their lcov outputs, and
enforces a new 85% aggregate global floor. No tests are added; no production
code is changed.

### Headline

| Metric | R7 (unit pipeline) | R7 (intg pipeline) | R8 aggregate |
|---|---|---|---|
| Filtered global coverage | 85.88% | n/a (per-file only) | **~88.4% (est.)** |
| Global floor | 82% | n/a | **85% (new)** |
| CI gate scripts | 2 | | **3 (+1)** |
| CI jobs | 2 | | **3 (+1)** |

The unit-pipeline figure (85.88%) and integration per-file floors (50/60/60/85)
are **unchanged**. The aggregate gate is purely additive.

### What landed

#### `scripts/check_aggregate_coverage.dart` (new)

Reads `coverage/lcov.info` (unit) and `coverage/integration.info` (integration)
via `parseLcovInputs` from `_lcov_parser.dart`, merges them (max hit-count per
line), applies the same exclude list as `check_coverage.dart`
(`app_localizations*`, `firebase_options`, `global_enums`, `l10n.dart`), and
enforces a single **85% aggregate global floor**. Does NOT re-enforce
tier-1/tier-2/per-file floors — those are already enforced upstream.

Exit codes: 0 = pass, 1 = floor miss, 2 = either input file absent (same
pattern as `check_integration_coverage.dart`).

#### `.github/workflows/main.yml` — new `coverage-aggregate` job

Runs with `needs: [build-android, integration-test]` AND
`if: ${{ always() }}` — the `always()` is deliberate: with bare `needs:`
alone, GitHub Actions skips this job when either upstream fails, and a
skipped required check can be treated as success by branch protection
(a failed-upstream PR could merge with the aggregate gate looking
green). With `always()`, the job runs on every PR and the first step
below fails fast if either dependency result is not `success`. Job
status is therefore always one of `{success, failure}` — never
`skipped`. See ADR-003 § Sub-decision E for the outcome table. Steps:

1. **Verify both upstream jobs succeeded** — reads
   `needs.build-android.result` and `needs.integration-test.result`,
   exits 1 with a clear `::error::` annotation if either is not
   `success` (covers failure, cancelled, skipped — all treated as
   not-success).
2. Checkout + Flutter setup (Dart needed for `dart run`).
3. `actions/download-artifact@v4` — downloads `coverage-lcov` artifact into
   `coverage/lcov.info`.
4. `actions/download-artifact@v4` — downloads `coverage-integration-lcov`
   artifact into `coverage/integration.info`.
5. `dart run scripts/merge_lcov.dart coverage/aggregate.info coverage/lcov.info
   coverage/integration.info` — merges into a separate `coverage/aggregate.info`
   (neither upstream lcov is clobbered).
6. `dart run scripts/check_aggregate_coverage.dart` — enforces 85% floor.
7. Upload `coverage/aggregate.info` as `coverage-aggregate-lcov` artifact
   (`if: always()` so it is available for debugging even on floor failures).

#### `docs/adr/ADR-003-phase-8-aggregate-coverage-gate.md` (new)

Documents all five sub-decisions (job location, floor value, blocking behaviour,
what the script enforces, skip/fail behaviour), the floor derivation arithmetic,
and the "what changes / what stays" table.

### Floor-value derivation

Unit baseline: 5576 / 6493 = **85.88%** (confirmed by
`dart run scripts/check_coverage.dart` on the R7 tip).

Integration contribution (modelled from R7 per-file post-merge %s and LF
counts in `coverage/lcov.info`):

| File | LF | Unit hits | Intg post-merge % | Intg hit est. | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `lib/main.dart` | 177 | 3 | 59.3% | 105 | +102 |
| `lib/pages/WellnessTools/player.dart` | 38 | 2 | 94.7% | 36 | +34 |
| `lib/util/logger_service.dart` | 19 | 2 | 73.7% | 14 | +12 |
| `lib/pages/notifications/notification_service.dart` | 63 | 42 | 90.6% | 57 | +15 |
| **Total** | — | — | — | — | **+163** |

Post-merge estimate: (5576 + 163) / 6493 = **88.39%**
Floor = 88.39% − 3.0 pt headroom = 85.39% → **85%**

The 3 pt cushion is consistent with every prior ratchet step and absorbs
integration-test run-to-run variance.

### ADR-002 deferred items — status update

The four files previously listed as "out of scope" in ADR-002 § "Out of scope
for Phase 7" are now included in the aggregate gate. Their per-file floors
remain in `check_integration_coverage.dart`; the aggregate gate provides an
additional combined ratchet.

| File | R6 unit% | R7 intg% (est) | Aggregate status | Still-uncovered branches |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `lib/main.dart` | 1.7% | ~59.3% | PARTIALLY CLOSED — `MyApp` StatefulWidget covered | `callbackDispatcher` (lines 42-89), `initializeApp` + `main()` body (lines 104-156): Firebase.initializeApp blocked in CI; background Workmanager entry-point unreachable from foreground test |
| `lib/pages/WellnessTools/player.dart` | 5.3% | ~94.7% | SUBSTANTIALLY CLOSED — all controller listener + lifecycle paths | Residual ~2 lines: race-condition edge in `dispose` under webview teardown |
| `lib/util/logger_service.dart` | 10.5% | ~73.7% | SUBSTANTIALLY CLOSED — captureLog happy path + init paths | Empty-DSN if-branch (lines 17-18, structurally dead in CI); outer catch branch (lines 29-31, swallowed by Sentry SDK internals) |
| `lib/pages/notifications/notification_service.dart` | 66.7% | ~90.6% | SUBSTANTIALLY CLOSED — scheduleNotification + init catch covered | iOS-specific notification paths; Android residual edge: background periodic-worker `executeTask` callback not reachable from foreground test |

The "still-uncovered branches" column lists only the branches that remain
documented as accepted risk after Phase 7 + Phase 8. None of them are
closeable under the no-production-change rule without a new ADR.

### Production code changes

None. `git diff lib/` is empty. Round 8 adds only:
- `scripts/check_aggregate_coverage.dart` (new gate script)
- `docs/adr/ADR-003-phase-8-aggregate-coverage-gate.md` (ADR)
- `.github/workflows/main.yml` (new `coverage-aggregate` job)
- `docs/coverage-status.md` (this section)

### Still deferred (post Phase 8)

| Item | Why still deferred | Unblock criterion |
|---|---|---|
| `main()` / `callbackDispatcher` / `initializeApp` direct coverage | Production-code `bootstrapApp()` extraction required (ADR-002 hard rule prohibits it without a new ADR) OR Firebase.initializeApp made available in CI integration-test context | Future ADR explicitly sanctioning the `bootstrapApp()` extraction, parallel to ADR-001's `firestore` injection precedent |
| Empty-DSN if-branch in `logger_service.dart` (lines 17-18) | Structurally dead in CI because `--dart-define=SENTRY_DSN=...` is always provided; dual-invocation integration-test variant (with and without dart-define) + lcov merge — pattern-2 of ADR-001 | Worth revisiting only if the aggregate floor benefit (estimated ~1 line) ever strains the 3 pt headroom |
| Outer catch branch in `logger_service.dart` (lines 29-31) | Sentry SDK swallows the channel `PlatformException` internally | Runtime-readable `_sentryDsn` (production change) OR different exception injection strategy — would require a new ADR |
| iOS-specific notification paths | macOS runner costs 10× Linux CI minutes; no iOS-specific bug has motivated it | A new ADR justifying a macOS runner integration job |
| `callbackDispatcher` / background Workmanager entry-point | Foreground integration tests cannot trigger background Workmanager callbacks | Background-worker test harness (e.g. Patrol background task driver) — explicitly out of ADR-002 scope |
| `lib/util/Firebase/firebase_functions.dart` ~287 uncovered lines | Defensive/error branches in helpers without `firestore` named param; adding the param violates the no-production-change rule | Production refactor to extend the `firestore` injection pattern to ~30 more helpers — separate ADR |

## Round 9 — Phase 9 ADR-004 execution (firestore injection extension + qe-test-architect)

Generated: 2026-05-24 — executes the path adopted in
[`docs/adr/ADR-004-phase-9-firestore-injection-extension-firebase-functions.md`](adr/ADR-004-phase-9-firestore-injection-extension-firebase-functions.md).
This round closes the largest remaining unit-pipeline gap from Round 8's
still-deferred table (`firebase_functions.dart` ~287 uncovered lines) by
extending the existing ADR-001 `firestore` named-param injection pattern
to 29 additional helpers and dispatching `qe-test-architect` to author
the corresponding unit tests against `FakeFirebaseFirestore`.

### Headline

| Metric | Round 8 | Round 9 | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unit tests | 586 + 8 skipped | **634 + 8 skipped** | +48 |
| Filtered global coverage (unit) | 85.88% | **89.33%** | +3.45 pts |
| `lib/util/Firebase/firebase_functions.dart` | 68.0% | **93.8%** (843/899) | +25.8 pts |
| Helpers with `firestore` named param | 14 | **43** | +29 |
| Unit global floor | 82% | **85%** | +3 pts |
| Aggregate global floor | 85% | **89%** | +4 pts |

### What landed

#### Production-code change — extend `firestore` injection pattern

`lib/util/Firebase/firebase_functions.dart` — 29 helpers gained the
optional `FirebaseFirestore? firestore` named param + the
`final _fs = firestore ?? FirebaseFirestore.instance;` body fallback,
mirroring the 14 helpers ADR-001 sanctioned in Round 1. **This is the
third sanctioned production-code exception to the no-production-changes
rule of the coverage initiative**, alongside ADR-001's Round-1
`firestore` injection (14 helpers) and ADR-002 PR #266's
`@visibleForTesting NotificationsService.resetForTest()` (1 method).
All three exceptions share the same shape: narrow, mechanical,
behavior-preserving for production paths, and necessary to reach a
genuinely-unreachable test seam without rewriting the file.

Helpers migrated (alphabetical within group):

- **Single-doc reads from `homePage-titles`** (8 helpers):
  `getJournalMainTitle`, `getJournalSeocndaryTitle`, `getTraitMainTitle`,
  `getTraitSeocndaryTitle`, `getPersonalPlanMainTitle`,
  `getPersonalPlanSecondaryTitle`, `getReminderMainTitle`,
  `getReminderSeocndaryTitle`.
- **Single-doc reads from other collections** (10 helpers):
  `getPersonalInfo`, `getIntroductionFormFirstPage`,
  `getIntroductionFormSecondPage`, `getIntroductionFormLastPage`,
  `getJournalTitle`, `getGreetingString`, `getReturnToPlan`,
  `getJournalPopUpText`, `getPositiveTraitsPopUpText`, `updateTest1`.
- **`bool male`-parameterised reads** (3 helpers, signature becomes
  `helperName(bool male, {FirebaseFirestore? firestore})`):
  `getMainTitle`, `getContactsTitle`, `getEmergancyTitle`.
- **`Warning` data-class returner** (1): `fetchWarnings`.
- **Multi-collection `update*` queries** (7 helpers):
  `updatePhoneFormTitles`, `updateFormDifficultEventsTitles`,
  `updateFormDistractionsTitles`, `updateFormFeelBetterTitles`,
  `updateFormMakeSaferTitles`, `updateFormSharePageTitles`,
  `updatePhonePersonalPlanText`.

`git diff lib/` for Phase 9 touches exactly one file.

**Analyzer state, precisely:**

- `dart analyze test/Firebase/firebase_functions_phase9_test.dart` ⇒
  `No issues found!` — the new test file is fully clean.
- `dart analyze lib/util/Firebase/firebase_functions.dart` ⇒ 48 issues:
  - **46 info-level** `no_leading_underscores_for_local_identifiers`
    messages on the `_fs` locals — these are the same shape as the
    pre-existing 14 helpers' `_fs` usage from Round 1 (ADR-001 sanctioned
    pattern); they are accepted as part of that pattern.
  - **2 pre-existing warnings unrelated to Phase 9**: an `unused_import`
    on `package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart` (line 10)
    and an `unused_catch_stack` on `stackTrace` (line 360). Both
    predate this round; `git blame` confirms neither was touched by
    the Phase 9 edits. They are tracked for a separate cleanup PR.

In short: Phase 9 added **zero new analyzer warnings**. The new infos
are the existing pattern; the two warnings predate the round.

#### Test code — `test/Firebase/firebase_functions_phase9_test.dart` (48 tests)

Authored end-to-end by `qe-test-architect` against the ADR-004 brief.
Pure-Dart unit tests using `package:fake_cloud_firestore/fake_cloud_firestore.dart`
as the seam — no platform channels, no widget scaffolding. Six `group(...)`
blocks organize the tests by helper shape:

1. **`homePage-titles` single-doc reads** (8 helpers × 1 happy-path test each).
2. **Introduction-form helpers** (3 helpers — first/second/last page, each
   asserting every keyed return field).
3. **Other single-doc reads** (`getPersonalInfo`, `getJournalTitle`,
   `getGreetingString`, `getReturnToPlan`, `getJournalPopUpText`,
   `getPositiveTraitsPopUpText`, `updateTest1` — 7 helpers).
4. **Gender-parameterised `PhonePage-titles` reads** (3 helpers × 2 cases
   each for `male=true`/`male=false` ⇒ 6 tests).
5. **`fetchWarnings`** (2 cases — multi-doc randomized selection + single-doc).
6. **Multi-collection `update*` helpers** (7 helpers, each with a
   happy-path test + 1-2 empty-collection throw-path tests asserting
   `Exception('No documents found in collection')`).

`flutter test test/Firebase/firebase_functions_phase9_test.dart` ⇒ all
48 pass. `dart analyze` on the new file ⇒ `No issues found!`.

The agent did NOT exercise the implicit `?? FirebaseFirestore.instance`
fallback (doing so would hit the real Firestore SDK and fail with "no
Firebase app") — the injection seam is validated by the happy-path test
using the fake, which is the same convention used by the 14 pre-existing
helpers' tests.

### Per-file deltas (vs Round 8)

| File | R8 | R9 (post-review) |
|---|---|---|
| `lib/util/Firebase/firebase_functions.dart` | 68.0% (612/900) | **93.8%** (797/850) |
| Global filtered coverage (unit) | 85.88% (5576/6493) | **89.29%** (5754/6444) |

The 53 residual uncovered lines in `firebase_functions.dart` (850 − 797)
are concentrated in:

- The unreachable `?? FirebaseFirestore.instance` right-hand sides on
  the helpers that have the named param (enumerated in Round 6, now
  applies to all 43 helpers).
- The `loadAppFromFirebase` switch arms that were already 100% in Round 4 — those
  are already covered, not residuals.

(The previously-flagged "third symmetric check path" defensive-throw
pattern was removed during the post-review correction below — those
lines no longer exist.)

### Post-review correction (PR #268 review, baz-reviewer 🔴 High finding)

`baz-reviewer[bot]` flagged a 🔴 High-severity finding on PR #268 line 1108
of `firebase_functions.dart`: `snapshot2.docs.isEmpty` is unguarded, can
cause a `RangeError` if `FormPage-PhonesPage` is empty. Validation:

- **Real defect (dead code in 3 helpers — fixed):** The duplicate
  `if (snapshot.docs.isEmpty)` block IS a copy/paste artifact, in three
  helpers, not just one:
  - `updatePhoneFormTitles` (was line 1107)
  - `updateFormDistractionsTitles` (was line 1245)
  - `updateFormFeelBetterTitles` (was line 1270)

  Each had a redundant second `snapshot.docs.isEmpty` check inserted
  between fetching `snapshot2` and the real `snapshot2.docs.isEmpty`
  guard. The blocks were structurally dead — the original
  `snapshot.docs.isEmpty` guard upstream already throws, so the
  duplicate could never fire. Removed (9 raw lines / 3 LF per helper).

- **Consequence claim (RangeError) was NOT real:** Each of the 3 helpers
  DOES already have a correct `snapshot2.docs.isEmpty` guard immediately
  after the dead block. If `FormPage-*` is empty, that real guard throws
  before any iteration — no `RangeError` path exists. The bot's severity
  rating was misleading.

- **Other `update*` helpers verified clean:** `updateFormDifficultEventsTitles`,
  `updateFormMakeSaferTitles`, `updateFormSharePageTitles`,
  `updatePhonePersonalPlanText`, and `updatePhonePageTitles` were each
  scanned and confirmed to have no duplicate-check pattern.

- **Fix narrative — fourth narrow ADR-004 exception:** This is the
  fourth sanctioned production-code touch in the coverage initiative,
  alongside ADR-001's `firestore` injection (Round 1, 14 helpers),
  ADR-002 PR #266's `@visibleForTesting resetForTest()` (Round 7),
  and ADR-004 Sub-decision A's named-param extension to 29 helpers
  (Round 9 initial). The shape matches the established discipline:
  narrow, mechanical, behaviour-preserving (dead-code removal IS
  behaviour-preserving by definition). No new ADR needed; tracked
  here as a post-review correction to Round 9.

- **Dedup ask (`_fetchFormFieldMap` extraction) — deferred:** Same
  disposition as PR #268 inline-comments #1 and #3 above. The dead-code
  cleanup is the narrow correctness fix; the structural dedup is a
  broader maintenance ask that deserves its own ADR.

**Coverage impact:** `firebase_functions.dart` pct holds steady at 93.8%
(797/850 vs 843/899 — same ratio, dead lines drop out of both numerator
and denominator). Global unit pct: 89.33% → 89.29% (−0.04 pt, within
noise; ~4.3 pt above the 85% floor). All 634 tests still pass without
modification (the test suite never relied on the dead-code throws since
they were unreachable).

### Floor ratchets

- `scripts/check_coverage.dart` `_globalThreshold`: **82.0 → 85.0**
  with updated comment noting "~89.3% as of round 9 (ADR-004)".
- `scripts/check_aggregate_coverage.dart` `_aggregateFloor`: **85.0 →
  89.0** with updated comment noting ADR-004 Phase 9 ratchet.

Per-file `_perFileFloors` and tier-1/tier-2 thresholds in
`check_coverage.dart` are **unchanged** — Phase 9 is global-floor-only.
The `lib/AnalyticsService.dart` 85% per-file floor continues to depend
on the CI dart-define merge step landed in Phase 6 (a local
`flutter test --coverage` without the merge shows 36.4% for that file,
documented as expected).

### Aggregate floor — estimated post-merge

Phase 9 only adds unit-pipeline tests; the integration pipeline is
unchanged. The aggregate estimate:

```
Unit hits (R9, post-correction):  5754 / 6444 = 89.29%
Integration delta (R8):           +163 lines  (unchanged — same 4 files)
Aggregate (R9 est):               5917 / 6444 = 91.83%
Aggregate floor proposal:         91.83% − 3 pt headroom = 88.83% → 89%
```

(The original Phase 9 proposal targeted 5800/6493 = 89.33% with aggregate
5963/6493 = 91.84%; the post-review dead-code removal — see § "Post-review
correction" above — dropped 9 raw lines from both numerator and denominator,
landing at 5754/6444. The 89% aggregate floor proposal holds either way.)

The 3 pt headroom matches every prior ADR-001/002/003 ratchet step.
First CI run on `tests/phase9-2026` will reveal the actual aggregate %
once the merged lcov is built; if it differs from 91.84% by more than
2 pts in either direction the floor will be revisited.

### Production code changes — summary

| Change | LOC | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 29 helper signatures + body fallbacks in `firebase_functions.dart` | ~60 LOC across the helpers | ADR-004 § Decision; extends ADR-001's narrowly-sanctioned pattern; behaviour-preserving for production paths |
| **No other `lib/` files modified** | 0 | `git diff lib/` outside `firebase_functions.dart` is empty |

### `skip: true` tests

No new skips. The 8 pre-existing skips from Round 1 (3 in
`Journal_test.dart`, 5 in `menu_test.dart`) remain untouched.

### Still deferred (post Phase 9)

The list shrinks by one (the `firebase_functions.dart` ~287-line item is
closed). The remaining accepted-risk items are unchanged from Round 8:

| Item | Why still deferred | Unblock criterion |
|---|---|---|
| `main()` / `callbackDispatcher` / `initializeApp` direct coverage | Production-code `bootstrapApp()` extraction required (ADR-002 hard rule prohibits it without a new ADR) | Future ADR sanctioning `bootstrapApp()` extraction parallel to ADR-001's `firestore` injection precedent and ADR-004's extension of it |
| Empty-DSN if-branch in `logger_service.dart` (lines 17-18) | Structurally dead in CI under `--dart-define=SENTRY_DSN=...` | Dual-invocation pattern-2 of ADR-001; benefit is ~1 line — revisit only if the aggregate floor strains the 3 pt headroom |
| Outer catch branch in `logger_service.dart` (lines 29-31) | Sentry SDK swallows the channel `PlatformException` internally | Runtime-readable `_sentryDsn` (production change) — would require a new ADR |
| iOS-specific notification paths | macOS runner costs 10× Linux CI minutes; no iOS-specific bug has motivated it | A new ADR justifying a macOS runner integration job |
| `callbackDispatcher` / background Workmanager entry-point | Foreground integration tests cannot trigger background Workmanager callbacks | Background-worker test harness (e.g. Patrol background task driver) — explicitly out of ADR-002 scope |
| `firebase_functions.dart` residual ~56 lines | Unreachable `?? FirebaseFirestore.instance` fallbacks (43 lines × 1 line each) + defensive triple-empty-checks (the third check is structurally dead in 4 update* helpers) | Test-side approach exhausted; would require either accepting those as dead lines or rewriting the helpers to not use the fallback shape (production rewrite — separate ADR) |

### Tooling used

- `qe-test-architect` (Agentic QE Fleet plugin) — sole tool used to
  author the 48 new tests. Per its self-reported summary: pure-Dart
  tests against `FakeFirebaseFirestore`, six logical groups, all
  passing, `dart analyze` clean.

This is the first round in the coverage initiative authored by an agent
rather than by hand. The agent's output was reviewed against the ADR-004
hard constraints (no `lib/` modifications, no platform-channel mocks,
no skipped tests, analyzer clean) — all four held without iteration.

## Round 10 — Phase 10 ADR-005 execution (macOS-runner iOS coverage, bootstrapApp extraction, web test gate)

> **Current-state update (2026-08-05):** The Round 10 iOS coverage design below
> is historical. The active `integration-test-ios` job is now blocking and runs
> `integration_test/fcm_initialization_ios_test.dart` without collecting lcov.
> The retired iOS-only coverage suite, its checker, its lcov input, and its
> artifact have been removed. Unit plus Android integration lcov remain the
> aggregate coverage inputs.

Generated: 2026-05-25 — executes the three sub-decisions adopted in
[`docs/adr/ADR-005-phase-10-macos-runner-ios-and-web-coverage.md`](adr/ADR-005-phase-10-macos-runner-ios-and-web-coverage.md).
This round is anchored on the constraint shift that open-source macOS
runners are free on GitHub Actions, which unblocks the iOS coverage items
ADR-002 / Round 9 deferred under a 10× cost framing. Round 10 also closes
one gap prior phases missed (the `main.dart` foreground bootstrap, stuck
at ~60% post-Round-7) and lands a **telemetry-only** web-platform job —
`unit-test-web-telemetry` — that surfaces failure modes of running the
unit suite under Chrome but does NOT yet gate anything. A strict web
gate (rename to `unit-test-web`, drop `continue-on-error: true`, wire
into `coverage-aggregate` needs, add a `scripts/check_web_coverage.dart`
sibling, merge web lcov into the aggregate) remains deferred until the
first telemetry runs surface their failure modes — tracked in the
"Still deferred (post Phase 10)" table below.

### Headline (estimated — first CI run will confirm)

| Unit tests | 634 + 8 skipped | unchanged | 0 |
| Integration tests (Android emulator) | 5 | unchanged | 0 |

### What landed

#### PR 10A — Retired iOS notification coverage design (ADR-005 § A)

- **The retired iOS-only coverage suite** (~250 LOC, 9 testWidgets in 5
  groups). It mirrored the Android sibling but exercised
  iOS-specific arms on a real iOS Simulator under
  `IntegrationTestWidgetsFlutterBinding`:
  - `supportsReminderSettings()` returns false on real iOS binding (no
    `debugDefaultTargetPlatformOverride` needed — the macos-14 + iOS sim
    sets `defaultTargetPlatform = iOS` naturally).
  - `init()` happy path reaches `plugin.initialize` via the iOS plugin
    variant (`DarwinInitializationSettings`).
  - `init()` is idempotent on iOS (second call short-circuits via
    `_isInitialized`).
  - `init()` catch branch on iOS forwards `IOS_TZ_FAIL` PlatformException
    to `IncidentLogger` and still calls `plugin.initialize` on the
    Asia/Jerusalem fallback.
  - `initializeNotification()` early-returns on iOS without reaching
    permission / schedule / toast calls.
  - `scheduleNotification()` direct call reaches `plugin.zonedSchedule`
    on iOS (bypasses the `supportsReminderSettings` gate to exercise
    cross-platform scheduling on the real iOS plugin).
  - `cancelNotifications(id)` and `cancelNotifications(null)` reach
    `plugin.cancel` / `plugin.cancelAll` on iOS.
  - Explicitly skips `cancelNotifications(null, cancelWorker: true)` —
    Workmanager has no iOS implementation; documented in the file
    header.
- **The retired iOS coverage checker** was a sibling of
  `check_integration_coverage.dart`. It read the former iOS lcov input and
  enforced a 60%
  per-file floor on `lib/pages/notifications/notification_service.dart`
  under the iOS invocation alone. Floor sized below the expected ~70-80%
  to absorb iOS surface differences vs Android (no Workmanager arm).
- **`.github/workflows/main.yml`** — new `integration-test-ios` job on
  `macos-14`. Boots the first available iPhone simulator via
  `xcrun simctl` (no third-party action — macos-14 ships with Xcode +
  iOS sim pre-installed), runs only the iOS test file with
  `-d "$DEVICE_ID"`. Uploads `coverage-integration-ios-lcov` artifact.
- **`coverage-aggregate` job updated** — `needs:` extended to
  `[build-android, integration-test, integration-test-ios]`; the
  upstream-result check covers all three; downloads the iOS lcov as a
  third artifact and passes it as a third input to
  `scripts/merge_lcov.dart` (which already accepts N positional args from
  PR #266's refactor).

#### PR 10B — `bootstrapApp()` extraction (ADR-005 § B, 4th sanctioned production exception)

- **`lib/main.dart`** — extracted
  `Future<Widget> bootstrapApp({firebaseInitializer, locatorSetup,
  workmanagerInitializer})` from the previous `main()` body. The helper
  performs `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` + Firebase init +
  service-locator setup + (on non-web) Workmanager init, then returns
  the `MultiProvider(... MyApp ...)` widget tree. Production `main()`
  reduced to:
  ```dart
  void main() async {
    final app = await bootstrapApp();
    final IncidentLoggerService sentryService =
        GetIt.instance<IncidentLoggerService>();
    await sentryService.initializeSentry(app);
  }
  ```
  `initializeApp(...)` also gained matching `firebaseInitializer` +
  `locatorSetup` injection seams (its only caller, `bootstrapApp`,
  forwards them through). All three named parameters default to the
  exact pre-extraction calls — behavior-preserving for production by
  construction. The CI `build-android` + `build-web` jobs build the app
  starting from `main()` and surface any regression.
  - **Fourth sanctioned production-code exception** to the no-production-
    changes guard rail, alongside:
    1. ADR-001 Round 1 — `firestore` named-param injection on 14 helpers
       in `firebase_functions.dart`.
    2. ADR-002 PR #266 — `@visibleForTesting
       NotificationsService.resetForTest()`.
    3. ADR-004 Round 9 — `firestore` injection extended to 29 more
       helpers in `firebase_functions.dart`.
- **`integration_test/bootstrap_full_test.dart`** (~250 LOC, 5
  testWidgets in 4 groups). Calls `bootstrapApp(...)` directly with
  fakes:
  - Group 1 — return shape: asserts all three injection seams fire
    (firebase, locator, workmanager), that the returned `MultiProvider`
    pumps to a tree containing exactly one `MyApp`.
  - Group 2 — pumps the returned widget: first frame renders the
    `CircularProgressIndicator` placeholder (locale='') branch;
    second-pass after async pumps settles to one of `FirstPage` /
    `Introduction` / progress (identical settle shape to the Phase-7
    `bootstrap_smoke_test.dart`).
  - Group 3 — default-fallback branch: omits `workmanagerInitializer`
    and asserts the fallback closure calls `Workmanager().initialize`
    via the `_SilentWorkmanager.register()` recorder.
  - Group 4 — `initializeApp(...)` standalone: asserts both injection
    seams fire and that fake services are registered post-call.
- **`scripts/check_integration_coverage.dart`** — `lib/main.dart`
  per-file floor raised 50.0 → 65.0 with a comment explaining the
  ratchet rationale (bootstrap-path now reachable; `callbackDispatcher`
  lines 42-89 stay uncovered).

#### PR 10C — web test telemetry job (ADR-005 § C — landed as TELEMETRY, not yet a gate)

- **`.github/workflows/main.yml`** — new `unit-test-web-telemetry` job
  on `ubuntu-latest` (renamed from the originally-planned
  `unit-test-web` to make its non-gating role obvious in CI logs and PR
  review). Runs `flutter test --platform chrome --coverage` with the
  same synthetic `SENTRY_DSN` dart-define the other jobs use.
  Uploads `coverage-web-lcov` artifact (`if-no-files-found: warn` so
  the upload succeeds when `flutter test` crashes before emitting lcov).
- **Deliberately green-on-failure during the triage phase:**
  - `continue-on-error: true` on the test step makes a `flutter test`
    crash report job-success — failures DO NOT fail this job.
  - The job is NOT in `coverage-aggregate`'s `needs:` list, so a
    missing/empty `coverage/lcov.info` cannot block the aggregate.
  - Step name explicitly says "telemetry — failures do NOT fail this
    job" so reviewers reading CI logs cannot mistake a green tick for
    a working gate.
- **Flip-to-gate criteria** (tracked as "still deferred (post Phase 10)"
  below): once the suite is green under `--platform chrome`, rename
  the job to `unit-test-web`, remove `continue-on-error: true`,
  introduce `scripts/check_web_coverage.dart` (sibling pattern), wire
  the job into `coverage-aggregate`'s `needs:` list, and add the web
  lcov as a fourth input to `scripts/merge_lcov.dart`. None of this
  happens until the first telemetry runs surface their failure modes.

This deliberate split — landing telemetry NOT a gate — surfaced during
PR 10B review (P2 finding): the original framing as "closes the web
gate" was misleading because `continue-on-error: true` + not-in-needs
meant Chrome test failures still produced a green workflow job. The
rename + explicit step-name warning + `if-no-files-found: warn` on the
upload make the non-gating role unambiguous; the flip to a real gate
is a future ADR-005 § C follow-up, not part of this round.

### Per-file deltas (estimated; first CI run will confirm)

| File | R9 | R10 (est) |
|---|---|---|
| `lib/main.dart` (aggregate) | ~59.3% | ~75-85% |
| `lib/pages/notifications/notification_service.dart` (aggregate) | ~90.6% | ~97% |
| Aggregate global coverage | ~91.83% | ~92.8% |

### Production code changes — summary

| Change | LOC | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| `bootstrapApp()` extraction + `initializeApp(...)` injection seams in `lib/main.dart` | ~30 LOC added, ~45 LOC reshuffled | ADR-005 § B; 4th sanctioned exception; defaults exactly match pre-extraction behavior; CI `build-android` + `build-web` surface any production regression |
| **No other `lib/` files modified** | 0 | `git diff lib/` outside `main.dart` is empty for Round 10 |

### `skip: true` tests

No new skips. The 8 pre-existing skips from Round 1 (3 in
`Journal_test.dart`, 5 in `menu_test.dart`) remain untouched.

### Still deferred (post Phase 10)

The list shrinks by two items (iOS-notification paths closed via the
new `integration-test-ios` gate; `main.dart` foreground bootstrap
closed via the `bootstrapApp()` extraction + `bootstrap_full_test.dart`).
The web-platform gate hole is **partially addressed** — telemetry
lands (`unit-test-web-telemetry`), but the strict gate stays deferred
(see entry below). Remaining accepted-risk items:

| Item | Why still deferred | Unblock criterion |
|---|---|---|
| `callbackDispatcher` (Workmanager background entry-point, `main.dart` lines 42-89) | Foreground integration tests cannot trigger a background `Workmanager().executeTask` callback | Background-worker test harness (e.g. Patrol's background task driver) — explicitly out of ADR-005 scope; needs its own ADR with motivation beyond coverage |
| `logger_service.dart` lines 17-18 (empty-DSN if-branch) | Structurally dead in CI under `--dart-define=SENTRY_DSN=...` | Dual-invocation pattern-2 of ADR-001; benefit is ~0.03 pt aggregate — revisit only if the 90% floor strains the 3 pt headroom |
| `logger_service.dart` lines 29-31 (outer catch) | Sentry SDK swallows the channel `PlatformException` internally | Runtime-readable `_sentryDsn` (5th production exception) — would require a new ADR |
| `firebase_functions.dart` residual ~43 `?? FirebaseFirestore.instance` fallback lines | Structurally unreachable under the injection pattern | Accept as dead under the existing tier-1 50% floor (file at 93.8%) or rewrite helpers to not use the fallback shape — separate refactor ADR |
| Web-platform `unit-test-web-telemetry` → `unit-test-web` strict gate flip | Initial landing is `continue-on-error: true` + not in `coverage-aggregate` needs (deliberately green-on-failure during triage) | Triage follow-up issues from first telemetry runs; rename job, drop `continue-on-error`, add `scripts/check_web_coverage.dart`, wire into aggregate `needs:` + `merge_lcov.dart` |
| iOS-specific arms that need `cancelWorker: true` | Workmanager has no iOS implementation | Future ADR if iOS background-fetch substitute is ever wired |

### CI floor ratchets (proposed — confirm after first CI run)

- `scripts/check_integration_coverage.dart` `lib/main.dart` per-file:
  **50.0 → 65.0** (landed in PR 10B).
- `scripts/check_aggregate_coverage.dart` aggregate global floor: **89%
  → 90%** (proposed; land in a follow-up after first three CI runs
  confirm the aggregate %).

### Doc bundling note

This round also commits the post-correction numbers polish in the
Round 9 § "Aggregate floor — estimated post-merge" section
(`5800/6493 → 5754/6444` etc.) that had been sitting uncommitted on the
working tree since the Round 9 PR-268 review.

### Tooling used

- All test files authored by hand. The `qe-test-architect` agent (used
  in Round 9) was not engaged: the Round 10 work is integration-test +
  CI-workflow + platform-channel-mocking heavy, where the agent's
  pure-Dart-against-fakes specialty doesn't apply.

### Open questions (still unresolved at landing)

Carried over from the Phase 10 plan; each will be answered by the first
CI run on this branch:

1. **Is the GitHub org opted into the open-source macOS-runner billing
   program?** First `integration-test-ios` job run will surface a billing
   error if not. If blocked, the job can be marked `continue-on-error: true`
   while the org opts in.
2. **Does `flutter test --platform chrome` work with the current Flutter
   3.41.6 pin given the project's dependency graph?** Triaged after the
   first `unit-test-web` job run; that's exactly what `continue-on-error:
   true` is there for.
3. **`bootstrapApp()` extraction reviewer signoff** — landed; ADR-005 § B
   makes the case explicitly. PR review will confirm or push back.



1. **Real production widgets only.** Never duplicate a `lib/...dart` widget into `test/...dart` and test the duplicate. The pattern in `test/helpers/widget_test_scaffold.dart` is the only sanctioned shape: register fakes on GetIt, wrap in MultiProvider + MaterialApp + ScreenUtilInit.
2. **Service layer fakes over mocks.** Implement the abstract `PersistentMemoryService` / `IncidentLoggerService` / `AnalyticsService` interfaces with simple in-memory recorders rather than reach for Mockito for these.
3. **Inject Firestore.** When testing functions that call `FirebaseFirestore.instance`, add an optional `FirebaseFirestore? firestore` named param defaulting to `.instance`, then pass `FakeFirebaseFirestore()` from tests. Already done for 14 helpers in `firebase_functions.dart`.
4. **Mock platform channels** (path_provider, fluttertoast) via `setMockMethodCallHandler` only when unit-testing a function that touches the channel directly. For widget tests, prefer mocking the higher-level service.
5. **`flutter test --coverage` runs in CI** — write tests for new code as you write the code, the gate will fail otherwise.
